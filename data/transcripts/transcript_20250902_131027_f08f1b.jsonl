{"ts": "00:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let's start with the current state. Can you walk me through the Aegis IAM architecture, especially the enforcement points we rely on in the Operate phase?"}
{"ts": "04:55", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. The IAM has three enforcement tiers: the SSO gateway layer, the RBAC decision engine, and the JIT provisioning microservice. Each tier has its own control plane; the gateway uses a policy-push model from our central auth store, the RBAC engine consumes signed role manifests, and JIT provisioning relies on ephemeral credential issuance with a 15‑minute TTL. All are monitored via the Aegis Control Console."}
{"ts": "09:30", "speaker": "I", "text": "And what did the last audit, AUD-24-Q2, flag that affects our RBAC or JIT processes?"}
{"ts": "14:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "The most notable finding was inconsistent role manifest signing for temporary admin roles in two clusters. The manifests were being cached longer than our 30‑minute max, which violates POL-SEC-001's clause 4.2.2 on least privilege and ephemeral rights."}
{"ts": "19:40", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do you ensure we're compliant with POL-SEC-001 on an ongoing basis?"}
{"ts": "24:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have an automated compliance check every 12 hours that validates role manifest expiry and compares active tokens against the JIT request log. Deviations trigger a Runbook RB-IAM-042 workflow to revoke and re‑issue credentials."}
{"ts": "30:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching to threat modeling, describe how you handle changes proposed in RFC-903."}
{"ts": "35:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "RFC-903 proposes adding a dynamic trust evaluation API. We run it through our STRIDE-based threat model, mapping new trust inputs to possible spoofing or elevation of privilege vectors. We prototype in our sand‑lab, record findings in TM‑Sheet‑903, and adjust the RFC if high‑severity threats lack mitigations."}
{"ts": "40:25", "speaker": "I", "text": "And vulnerabilities in IAM components—how are they tracked and prioritized?"}
{"ts": "45:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "We log them in VULNREG with tags for component, severity, and exploitability. Prioritization is CVSS-based but adjusted by asset criticality. For example, a medium CVSS in the RBAC engine serving Orion Edge Gateway jumps to P1 due to its cross‑system impact."}
{"ts": "50:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do you limit blast radius if a privileged token is compromised?"}
{"ts": "55:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "We segment scopes so tokens can only act within one tenant’s context. Plus, JIT tokens lack renewal capability—once expired, they require a fresh approval chain per RB-IAM-075. We've also scripted an emergency token revocation sweeping all microservices within 90 seconds."}
{"ts": "61:10", "speaker": "I", "text": "Which other Novereon projects consume Aegis IAM for authentication?"}
{"ts": "66:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "Seven in total, but the biggest are Orion Edge Gateway, Helios Data Lake, and Poseidon Networking’s control APIs. Each has different trust boundaries: Orion is semi‑trusted, Helios is internal‑trusted, Poseidon is fully trusted but high‑impact. Our integration contracts define token audience claims accordingly."}
{"ts": "72:25", "speaker": "I", "text": "Give me an example where IAM changes affected Orion Edge Gateway."}
{"ts": "90:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "In March, a schema change in RBAC role definitions—ticket CHG‑IAM‑221—caused Orion's API filter to reject valid tokens due to a missing 'device_class' claim. This took down edge onboarding for 47 minutes until we rolled back. We now sync schema changes with Orion’s team via pre‑deployment mTLS validation tests in Poseidon's staging net."}
{"ts": "90:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "To move us toward the close, could you walk me through RB-IAM-075 in the context of the last emergency access revocation you handled?"}
{"ts": "90:08", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. RB-IAM-075 defines step-by-step the emergency access revocation process. In our last case—incident ticket INC-24-118—we detected anomalous privilege escalation via our SIEM alerts. Following the runbook, we isolated the affected account in under 7 minutes, revoked all active tokens, and logged each API call to the revocation endpoint. This log trail satisfied our SLA-SEC-004 response time."}
{"ts": "90:32", "speaker": "I", "text": "And in terms of evidence collection, what specifically do you retain to meet the compliance audit requirements?"}
{"ts": "90:38", "speaker": "E", "text": "We capture a combination of immutable logs from the IAM core, correlated with Poseidon Networking's mTLS session records. Additionally, we export an event timeline with UTC timestamps, include screenshots of the admin console state, and attach the revocation API payloads. All of this is stored in the secured evidence repository under EVID-24-INC118 for at least 18 months per COM-RET-002."}
{"ts": "91:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "How are those learnings actually fed back into your operational documentation?"}
{"ts": "91:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "After closure, we run a post-incident review. For INC-24-118, we updated RB-IAM-075 to include an explicit check for orphaned service accounts—this came from a gap we saw during the revocation. We also raised RFC-921 to adjust token lifetime defaults, which went through the Change Advisory Board last month."}
{"ts": "91:34", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let's talk about trade-offs. Can you give me a concrete case where you had to choose between keeping systems online and enforcing least privilege to the letter?"}
{"ts": "91:42", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, during the Q1 Orion Edge Gateway firmware rollout, one integration service lost its delegated permissions due to a stricter RBAC policy push from Aegis IAM. We had the choice: roll back the RBAC change or allow a temporary policy bypass. Given the SLA with the client-facing teams, we issued a 4-hour time-boxed bypass, documented in EXC-24-004, under POL-SEC-001 exceptions, and monitored every call from that service."}
{"ts": "92:10", "speaker": "I", "text": "What alternatives for JIT access provisioning have you considered, and why were they rejected?"}
{"ts": "92:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "We evaluated three: a push-based ephemeral role grant, a pull-based self-service with approval, and a hybrid. The push-based risked stale grants if revocation failed; the pull-based added latency unacceptable to Ops. The hybrid was complex and had interdependency issues with Poseidon's policy engine. We chose pull-based with pre-approved templates for critical teams to balance speed and control."}
{"ts": "92:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "Residual risk is always a tricky topic. How do you quantify it for stakeholders?"}
{"ts": "92:47", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use a modified CVSS scoring contextualized for IAM. For each risk, like token replay, we calculate likelihood from past incident frequency and impact from potential blast radius, as per RISK-MTH-003. Then we present it on a 5x5 heatmap, with mitigation status. For example, after RFC-903 changes, residual risk for over-provisioning dropped from 'High' to 'Medium'."}
{"ts": "93:12", "speaker": "I", "text": "Do you get pushback when communicating these?"}
{"ts": "93:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "Occasionally. Product teams sometimes argue that our 'Medium' still feels like 'Low' to them. We address that by showing incident simulations and, in one case, replaying a red-team test against a staging environment to illustrate the risk clearly."}
{"ts": "93:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "Final question: what’s the single biggest operational risk in Aegis IAM right now, and how are you mitigating it?"}
{"ts": "93:42", "speaker": "E", "text": "Currently, the biggest is dependency drift between Aegis IAM and downstream services like Orion Edge Gateway. A mismatch in mTLS cipher suites last quarter caused authentication failures. We’re mitigating by implementing automated compatibility checks in our CI/CD pipeline and adding a handshake verification step into RB-IAM-062 before any service deployment."}
{"ts": "100:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned Poseidon Networking mTLS enforcement. Can you detail how you validate those policies are applied end-to-end across the Aegis IAM and its consuming systems?"}
{"ts": "100:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we run scheduled conformance tests described in RUN-POS-221. Those tests spin up ephemeral service pairs—one legitimate, one with altered cert chain—and attempt mutual TLS handshakes. In the last cycle, for example, Orion Edge Gateway failed the negative test until we rolled out patch CFG-OEG-19."}
{"ts": "100:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "And those results, are they fed into the IAM dashboard or tracked separately?"}
{"ts": "101:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "They are integrated into the IAM Ops dashboard via our internal MetricsStream collector. Each failed test generates a TKT-MTLS-* ticket, which is linked to the affected service's backlog. That creates traceability when the same service consumes Aegis-issued tokens."}
{"ts": "101:40", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching gears, have you encountered a case where IAM config drift in one consumer impacted others unexpectedly?"}
{"ts": "101:56", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, mid-Q1 we saw drift in the RBAC roles consumed by NovaOps Portal. The Portal's team widened the 'ops_admin' role in their local cache, which meant Orion Edge Gateway suddenly received expanded scopes because it reused those claims via a chained trust. We rolled back via CFG-RBAC-07 and updated the cross-system role mapping runbook."}
{"ts": "102:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "That sounds like a multi-hop trust issue—was there no safeguard in place?"}
{"ts": "102:42", "speaker": "E", "text": "There was, but it was reactive. The safeguard was a nightly role-scope audit job. Unfortunately, the drift occurred and was exploited in a 6‑hour window before detection. We’re now moving to real-time claims validation using the Aegis policy engine's webhook feature."}
{"ts": "103:08", "speaker": "I", "text": "On that webhook plan, what trade-offs are you considering? Any operational concerns?"}
{"ts": "103:25", "speaker": "E", "text": "Latency is the main one. Synchronous callbacks on every token mint add ~80ms on average. We tested async with cached decisions, but that reintroduces drift risk. According to RFC-941-DRAFT, we're prioritizing security over speed for privileged scopes, and allowing async for low-risk scopes."}
{"ts": "103:58", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do you justify that to stakeholders who are worried about user experience?"}
{"ts": "104:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use SLA-SIGN-03 which defines max acceptable auth latency at 250ms for critical workflows. Our measurements with synchronous checks still keep us under that. We present before/after graphs and incident post-mortem data, especially from the NovaOps drift, to show the benefit outweighs the small delay."}
{"ts": "104:46", "speaker": "I", "text": "Makes sense. Regarding threat modeling under RFC-903, can you give a concrete example involving both IAM and a network policy change?"}
{"ts": "105:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure, RFC-903 proposed allowing Orion Edge Gateway to initiate calls to a new analytics service. We modeled the threat as: expanded attack surface + potential exfiltration via scoped API keys. Mitigation combined Poseidon’s egress controls and refining Aegis’s JIT scopes to exclude analytics endpoints unless explicitly approved in the request payload."}
{"ts": "105:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "And after implementation, how was this monitored?"}
{"ts": "106:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We instrumented both systems with telemetry hooks. Any token used against analytics APIs is logged with a JIT request ID. Cross-correlation with Poseidon's flow logs lets us verify no out-of-policy access. That’s documented in MON-IAM-NET-12 and tied to monthly compliance review."}
{"ts": "106:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the Poseidon Networking mTLS policy enforcement—can you expand on how you validate that enforcement across heterogeneous consumers of Aegis IAM?"}
{"ts": "106:08", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, so we run a scheduled mTLS compliance check every 12 hours using our internal tool 'CertScope'. It pulls the active service identity from Aegis IAM and then tries to establish a mutual TLS handshake. If the handshake fails or the CN doesn't match the registered service in REG-SVC, the tool files a P1 ticket automatically—last time it was TCK-45132 for Orion Edge Gateway."}
{"ts": "106:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "And was that incident with Orion Edge Gateway linked to a change in IAM configs or in the networking layer?"}
{"ts": "106:34", "speaker": "E", "text": "It was a multi-hop root cause. The initial trigger was an IAM schema update from RFC-903 that altered the service identity format. Poseidon Networking's policy parser didn't recognize the new format, so mTLS handshakes silently downgraded to TLS-only. That slipped past the first-line monitoring until CertScope caught it."}
{"ts": "106:54", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting—so that ties an IAM change to a networking enforcement gap. How did you close that loop?"}
{"ts": "107:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We applied a hotfix to the policy parser, rolled back the schema change in IAM temporarily, and added a pre-deploy mTLS validation step into the IAM CI/CD pipeline. That step is now codified in RUN-IAM-DEP-017."}
{"ts": "107:16", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching gears—how do you decide the blast radius for a compromised privileged token, especially in a Just-In-Time context?"}
{"ts": "107:23", "speaker": "E", "text": "We calculate it based on three factors: the token's assigned roles, the expiry time, and the network segments accessible. In JIT mode, maximum expiry is 15 minutes per POL-SEC-001. We also apply micro-segmentation tags so that even if the token leaks, it can only operate within a specific domain—like IDM-OPS rather than PROD-ALL."}
{"ts": "107:43", "speaker": "I", "text": "Have you ever had to shorten that expiry even further due to an active threat?"}
{"ts": "107:49", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, during incident INC-2024-044 in March, we detected abnormal elevation requests from a compromised admin endpoint. We invoked RB-IAM-075 to revoke tokens and temporarily reduced JIT expiry to 5 minutes for all admin roles until forensic analysis cleared the breach vector."}
{"ts": "108:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "And that reduction—was it manual or automated?"}
{"ts": "108:09", "speaker": "E", "text": "Manual trigger via the IAM control plane. Automation exists in RUN-IAM-SEC-009, but we require human approval for expiry changes to avoid accidental DoS on legitimate ops."}
{"ts": "108:21", "speaker": "I", "text": "In terms of risk communication—how did you convey the operational impact of that to other service owners?"}
{"ts": "108:27", "speaker": "E", "text": "We issued a 'Security Bulletin' via the internal CommsHub, detailing the change, its rationale, and expected impacts. We included a risk matrix from RSK-IAM-2024-Q1 showing the residual risk rating dropping from High to Medium after expiry reduction, but also flagged potential delays in admin workflows."}
{"ts": "108:44", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there alternative mitigations considered that wouldn't have impacted admin workflows as much?"}
{"ts": "108:49", "speaker": "E", "text": "We considered geo-fencing privileged sessions to the data center subnets only, but our telemetry showed many legitimate admin ops coming from remote secure gateways. The trade-off was too steep in terms of operational continuity, so expiry reduction was the least disruptive high-impact measure."}
{"ts": "114:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned cross-system impacts — can you elaborate on a specific case where Aegis IAM changes rippled into Poseidon Networking's mTLS enforcement?"}
{"ts": "114:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, during RFC-912, when we updated the mutual TLS certificate rotation cadence in IAM's service mesh, Poseidon Networking's sidecar proxies rejected several legitimate Orion Edge Gateway requests. The root cause was a mismatch between IAM's new cert issuance format and Poseidon's validation regex."}
{"ts": "114:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how did you detect that? Was it automated monitoring or user reports?"}
{"ts": "114:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "It was a blend — our mTLS handshake latency dashboard in Grafana spiked, and concurrently, Orion's support queue logged multiple 'AUTH-503' tickets. We correlated timestamps and packet captures to confirm the cross-system failure."}
{"ts": "114:32", "speaker": "I", "text": "What was the mitigation path?"}
{"ts": "114:36", "speaker": "E", "text": "We rolled back to the prior cert format using runbook RB-NET-042, which is specifically for mTLS regression scenarios, while drafting RFC-913 to align both systems' regex patterns. We also added a pre-prod integration test in the CI pipeline for future cert changes."}
{"ts": "114:48", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given that, what lessons did you extract for IAM's dependency management?"}
{"ts": "114:53", "speaker": "E", "text": "Two main ones: first, any protocol-level change in IAM must trigger contract tests with all registered consumers in our Service Registry; second, dependency owners must sign off on the change in the RFC process before merge. We codified both in POL-SYS-DEP-002."}
{"ts": "115:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching gears to vulnerabilities — how do you prioritise fixes if a flaw affects both IAM core and a dependent like Orion?"}
{"ts": "115:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use our Vulnerability Impact Matrix (VIM-01), which scores on exploitability, affected assets, and cross-system propagation. If both IAM and Orion are affected, the score gets a propagation multiplier. That often moves the issue into the 'P1' SLA category, requiring a fix within 24 hours."}
{"ts": "115:22", "speaker": "I", "text": "Can you give an example of such a case?"}
{"ts": "115:26", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure, in ticket SEC-884 last quarter, a JWT parsing bug in IAM allowed certain malformed tokens through, and Orion's API gateway trusted those tokens. The VIM score hit 9.2/10, so we deployed a hotfix to IAM and pushed an emergency rule to Orion to reject unverified token claims."}
{"ts": "115:39", "speaker": "I", "text": "Circling back to trade-offs, in that SEC-884 scenario, did you have to choose between uptime and immediate enforcement?"}
{"ts": "115:44", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, enforcing the new token rules caused a brief auth outage for some legitimate sessions. We accepted a 15-minute downtime for the affected services, documenting the decision under RISK-LOG-2024-07 with sign-off from the CISO, because the alternative was allowing a critical auth bypass."}
{"ts": "115:57", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did you communicate that risk acceptance formally to all stakeholders?"}
{"ts": "116:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We issued a Security Advisory Bulletin (SAB-24-07) to all project leads, outlining the exploit, the mitigation, the downtime, and the residual risk. We also updated runbook RB-IAM-SEC-001 to include a rapid comms template for such cross-system auth incidents."}
{"ts": "116:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned how RB-IAM-075 shaped the emergency process. Now, looking ahead, how will you adapt that for the upcoming Aegis IAM 4.2 release in Q3?"}
{"ts": "116:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "For 4.2, we are extending RB-IAM-075 with a pre-authorized escalation matrix, so that if a JIT account fails to deprovision via the API, we can trigger the revocation flow via a secondary channel in less than 90 seconds, which still meets our SLA-SEC-02 thresholds."}
{"ts": "116:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "And that SLA-SEC-02, does it explicitly account for cross-system impacts, say, on the Orion Edge Gateway?"}
{"ts": "116:22", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we codified that in the SLA appendix last quarter. It explicitly includes dependent systems like Orion and Helios Batch Manager. We run synthetic revocation drills—this is linked to DRILL-OG-14—to ensure IAM revocations propagate without breaking their active sessions unexpectedly."}
{"ts": "116:35", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of drills, how do you validate that the Poseidon Networking mTLS policies are still intact after a revocation?"}
{"ts": "116:42", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a post-revocation verification step defined in VER-IAM-008. It spins up a controlled service-to-service call from a quarantined namespace using the revoked cert. If mTLS is enforced properly, the handshake fails and that test result is logged in our SIEM with evidence hash IDs like EVH-2217."}
{"ts": "116:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given that, what’s your current blast radius estimation if such enforcement silently fails?"}
{"ts": "117:01", "speaker": "E", "text": "We model it in THR-BLAST-12. In worst case, lateral movement could occur into two tier-2 services within 15 minutes. But with our current segmentation and anomaly detection from SentinelAI, the likelihood is categorized as 'low' and residual risk is communicated in our quarterly risk register."}
{"ts": "117:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do stakeholders react when you present a 'low' but high-impact residual risk?"}
{"ts": "117:21", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use an impact-likelihood matrix in RPT-RISK-Q4. Even for 'low' likelihood, if impact is critical, we discuss compensating controls. For example, last review led to adding an IAM-side hard timeout on all delegated admin tokens regardless of activity."}
{"ts": "117:35", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there any trade-offs in implementing that hard timeout?"}
{"ts": "117:40", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes. Ops teams complained about token expiry during long migrations. We had to introduce a temporary exemption mechanism documented in RFC-988, with tight approval workflows, so we didn't block critical maintenance."}
{"ts": "117:52", "speaker": "I", "text": "Does RFC-988 tie back into POL-SEC-001's least privilege mandate?"}
{"ts": "117:57", "speaker": "E", "text": "It does. The exemptions are role-scoped and time-bound, and we log them to the same audit trail as standard JIT grants. Compliance checked that against POL-SEC-001 and signed off with minor notations."}
{"ts": "118:08", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given all the above, what’s the single biggest operational risk you’re carrying into Q3?"}
{"ts": "118:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "Frankly, the biggest is integration lag with third-party identity providers in Aegis IAM federation. If they delay propagating revocation signals, our internal enforcement is moot. Mitigation is ongoing via FED-SYNC-05, aiming for sub-60 second propagation by end of Q3."}
{"ts": "120:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned RFC-903 in passing. Could you walk me through how you actually performed the threat modeling for that change in Aegis IAM?"}
{"ts": "120:08", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. RFC-903 was about introducing adaptive session lifetimes. We started by identifying all the trust boundaries—user device, reverse proxy layer, and the RBAC engine. Then we ran a STRIDE analysis on each component. That exposed a spoofing risk if session renewal webhooks were intercepted. We simulated that in our staging env using our standard ThreatSim scripts from runbook RB-THREAT-021."}
{"ts": "120:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "And once you identified that spoofing risk, how did you mitigate it before rollout?"}
{"ts": "120:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "We mandated mTLS for the webhook channel, leveraging Poseidon Networking's PKI. We also added nonce validation tied to our JIT token issuance service. This was documented in the RFC's security appendix and cross-referenced to POL-SEC-001 to ensure least privilege remained intact."}
{"ts": "120:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of Poseidon, how do you validate that their mTLS enforcement is still active across all Aegis IAM service-to-service calls?"}
{"ts": "120:57", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a quarterly control from AUD-24-Q2 that requires a synthetic transaction test. Our monitoring agent in the test cluster tries to connect without a client cert; if it gets past the ingress gateway, the test fails. Last quarter all tests passed, and we logged the evidence in ticket SEC-EVID-442 for compliance."}
{"ts": "121:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Can you recall an incident where a change in IAM had unintended effects on, say, Orion Edge Gateway?"}
{"ts": "121:21", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in February, a schema change in the claims object removed a legacy 'orgUnit' field. Orion Edge Gateway's policy engine still referenced it for regional routing. The result was a partial outage in APAC. We rolled back within 45 minutes, but it highlighted the need for our integration test suite to include dependent systems' policy assertions."}
{"ts": "121:45", "speaker": "I", "text": "How did you adapt your processes after that?"}
{"ts": "121:49", "speaker": "E", "text": "We updated runbook RB-IAM-DEP-004 to include a pre-deploy contract test phase. Now, any claim schema change must trigger regression tests in Orion's staging environment. It’s automated via our CI/CD integration, so breakages are caught before production."}
{"ts": "122:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "On the vulnerability management side, what's your prioritization model for IAM component CVEs?"}
{"ts": "122:11", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use a weighted scoring system: CVSS base score, exploitability in our context, and component criticality. For example, a CVSS 7.5 in a transient admin UI used only internally might be lower priority than a 6.5 in the token signing module. We document prioritization in VULN-REG-iam.xlsx and review weekly."}
{"ts": "122:32", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. And if a privileged token is compromised, what’s your standard approach to limit the blast radius?"}
{"ts": "122:38", "speaker": "E", "text": "First, we revoke the token via the revocation endpoint and trigger our Just-In-Time issuance cooldown—no new high-privilege tokens for 30 minutes. Then we rotate the signing keys if the compromise vector is unclear. Access logs from the last 24 hours are dumped into the forensics bucket for analysis, as defined in RB-IAM-075 section 4."}
{"ts": "122:58", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, how do you quantify residual risk from these scenarios to stakeholders who may not be security-savvy?"}
{"ts": "123:04", "speaker": "E", "text": "We translate technical risk into potential SLA breach probabilities. For instance, after RFC-903, our model showed a 0.5% increase in session renewal failures, equating to ~2 hours of potential degraded SSO performance per year. Presenting it in SLA impact terms tends to resonate more with business stakeholders than raw CVSS scores."}
{"ts": "135:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the Poseidon Networking mTLS enforcement. Can you clarify how you validate those policies when Aegis IAM issues tokens to a microservice cluster?"}
{"ts": "135:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, so for each token issuance event, the audit hook in Aegis IAM logs the service identity and the presented mTLS certificate fingerprint. We have a validation job—VA-IAM-022—that runs nightly comparing those fingerprints against the Poseidon CA trust store. Any deviation triggers a Sev-2 alert per our OPS-SLA-08."}
{"ts": "135:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "And is that validation cross-checked with any external systems, or purely internal?"}
{"ts": "135:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "We do cross-check with the Orion Edge Gateway logs. It's a bit of a multi-hop: IAM logs go into the central SIEM, then we correlate with Orion's ingress mTLS logs. That ensures no rogue certificate is being accepted at the edge while IAM still trusts it."}
{"ts": "136:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Can you give an example where that multi-hop correlation caught something?"}
{"ts": "136:23", "speaker": "E", "text": "Back in April, Ticket INC-NE-431 showed an expired cert on a deprecated analytics microservice. Poseidon still had it in a secondary trust list, but Orion was rejecting it. The correlation flagged the mismatch, and we purged the stale cert from IAM within two hours."}
{"ts": "136:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. So, switching topics slightly—how do you handle threat modeling for RFC-903, since it introduced a new delegated admin role?"}
{"ts": "137:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "We applied STRIDE analysis specifically focused on elevation of privilege and spoofing. The delegated admin could, if misconfigured, issue JIT access beyond their realm. So we implemented a constraint in the policy engine: the realm attribute of the admin must match the target resource's realm, validated at runtime against the RBAC directory."}
{"ts": "137:30", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did you simulate any compromise scenarios for that?"}
{"ts": "137:38", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in our Red Team exercise EX-IAM-07, we created a fake delegated admin in the staging environment. The attempt to issue cross-realm access failed due to the constraint, and the event was recorded in the threat model logbook, as per RUN-IAM-TM-003."}
{"ts": "138:02", "speaker": "I", "text": "When you decide on constraints like that, do you weigh them against possible operational slowdowns?"}
{"ts": "138:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Absolutely. In fact, we logged an RFC-915 to adjust the policy evaluation timeout from 500ms to 800ms to accommodate the extra realm check without causing false negatives under load. We presented the latency impact—about 1.5%—to the change advisory board, who accepted it as low residual risk."}
{"ts": "138:40", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how was that residual risk communicated to stakeholders?"}
{"ts": "138:48", "speaker": "E", "text": "We used the quarterly security dashboard, adding a note under 'Policy Engine Performance'. It linked to evidence from PERF-IAM-2024Q2 benchmarks and included mitigation steps like precomputing realm maps during low-traffic windows."}
{"ts": "139:12", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking forward, are there any upcoming trade-offs you foresee in JIT provisioning for the next release?"}
{"ts": "139:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we're evaluating asynchronous JIT approval flows to reduce admin burden, but that means tokens might be pending in a queue for up to 90s. Risk is that urgent access in incidents could be delayed. We'll likely pilot it in non-critical realms first, per our staged rollout policy in RUN-IAM-DEP-005."}
{"ts": "143:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let’s pivot to the cross-system dependencies again, specifically the Poseidon Networking mTLS enforcement. How do you verify in production that IAM service-to-service traffic is indeed adhering to those policies?"}
{"ts": "143:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use a combination of synthetic probes and live telemetry from Envoy sidecars. Runbook RB-NET-042 outlines the command sequence to query the Poseidon policy API, pull the current mTLS cert fingerprints, and match them against our IAM service registry. This runbook also includes weekly SpotCheck tasks, which our SRE rotation executes."}
{"ts": "143:25", "speaker": "I", "text": "Have you ever found a deviation during those SpotChecks?"}
{"ts": "143:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, once in March. A new microservice that was part of Orion Edge Gateway integration was missing the Poseidon mTLS config. Our automated alert caught it—ticket SEC-INC-2213—and we pushed a config hotfix within the SLA of 30 minutes."}
{"ts": "143:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of Orion, can you walk me through the multi-hop trust relationship there? I’m interested in how Aegis IAM, Poseidon Networking, and Orion Edge Gateway intersect."}
{"ts": "144:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. Orion Edge Gateway uses Aegis IAM for both device auth and operator SSO. It connects over Poseidon’s secure mesh, which enforces mTLS and policy-based routing. When an Orion operator authenticates, Aegis issues short-lived JWTs, which are then validated by Orion’s API layer through Poseidon’s secure channel. The multi-hop here is: Operator → Orion UI → Orion API → Poseidon mesh → IAM token endpoint."}
{"ts": "144:25", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. Does that multi-hop introduce any latency or availability concerns?"}
{"ts": "144:34", "speaker": "E", "text": "Latency is minimal—~120ms on average. Availability is more sensitive; if Poseidon’s policy engine is degraded, token validation may fail. We mitigate with a local JWT cache at Orion API, following RFC-903’s guidelines for offline validation, but limit cache TTL to 5 minutes to cap the blast radius."}
{"ts": "144:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned RFC-903 for offline validation—how did you threat-model that change?"}
{"ts": "145:06", "speaker": "E", "text": "We ran it through our STRIDE-based model in ThreatDesk. The main risks were replay attacks and stale privilege data. Mitigations included signing tokens with a rotating keypair and setting the short TTL I mentioned. We documented all this in ThreatModel-TM-019, which was cross-reviewed by both the IAM and Networking security leads."}
{"ts": "145:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "Good. Now, thinking about the upcoming audit, what’s your plan to demonstrate ongoing compliance for these cross-system integrations?"}
{"ts": "145:39", "speaker": "E", "text": "We’re preparing an Evidence Binder—EB-SEC-24Q3—that includes SpotCheck logs, mTLS cert rotation records, and sampled JWT validation logs. We also include tickets like SEC-INC-2213 to show detection and remediation workflows are active and effective."}
{"ts": "145:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "Alright, shifting to a decision point: there’s been talk of relaxing JIT access TTLs for certain NOC roles to improve operational continuity during incidents. Where do you stand on this?"}
{"ts": "146:08", "speaker": "E", "text": "I’m cautious. Extending TTL from 15 to 60 minutes reduces friction but increases exposure if a token is hijacked. Our residual risk calculation—RRC-27—shows a 2.3× increase in potential impact. I proposed an alternative: keep 15 minutes TTL, but enable automated re-request with minimal user input during ongoing incidents."}
{"ts": "146:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did stakeholders accept that compromise?"}
{"ts": "146:36", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, after I presented incident data from the last 12 months showing that 78% of NOC escalations were resolved within a 15-minute JIT window. The remaining 22% were either low-impact or had explicit management override already documented in RB-IAM-080."}
{"ts": "146:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned some dependencies with Orion Edge Gateway; can we dig into how Aegis IAM's mTLS enforcement interacts with Poseidon Networking policies?"}
{"ts": "146:07", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. In our architecture diagram, each IAM enforcement point—like the token exchange microservice—initiates an outbound mTLS handshake using Poseidon's certificate authority chain. We validate that the CN matches the service identity defined in POL-NET-004."}
{"ts": "146:22", "speaker": "I", "text": "And what happens if that CN validation fails in production? Are there automated safeguards?"}
{"ts": "146:29", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, the handshake aborts and the request is denied. There’s also a hook into our Alertmanager that raises a SEV-2 incident. Runbook RB-NET-021 covers the triage steps—mostly checking for cert expiry or misaligned trust boundaries."}
{"ts": "146:45", "speaker": "I", "text": "So if Orion Edge Gateway updates its service cert without notifying IAM, you'd see an alert quickly."}
{"ts": "146:51", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. We had that case in March; Orion's build pipeline rotated certs after a hotfix, which triggered an IAM outage for their API calls. We had to coordinate a rollback via RFC-998 emergency procedure."}
{"ts": "147:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Was that linked to any vulnerabilities or just operational misstep?"}
{"ts": "147:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Primarily operational. We reviewed the chain in our vulnerability management board—ticket VM-2024-113—but no CVEs were involved. The lesson was adding a pre-rotation notification SLA between teams."}
{"ts": "147:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of SLAs, what’s the response SLA for IAM incidents at SEV-2 impacting cross-system auth?"}
{"ts": "147:35", "speaker": "E", "text": "Per OPS-SLA-007, initial triage in 15 minutes, mitigation in 45. We’ve met that 97% of the time in the last quarter per AUD-OPS-Q2 report."}
{"ts": "147:48", "speaker": "I", "text": "Good. Let's circle back to threat modeling: when you evaluate a change in RFC-903, how do you include these interdependencies?"}
{"ts": "147:56", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use the STRIDE framework, but we extend 'Elevation of Privilege' to consider federated services. So if Orion consumes a new IAM endpoint, we model spoofing risks across both service meshes."}
{"ts": "148:10", "speaker": "I", "text": "And is that documented somewhere other teams can access?"}
{"ts": "148:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in the shared Confluence under AEG-RFC-903 Threat Model v1.2. It’s linked from the change control entry and tagged with affected systems."}
{"ts": "148:26", "speaker": "I", "text": "That’s helpful. Finally, post-March incident, did you adjust any runbooks or was it purely process change?"}
{"ts": "148:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "Both. RB-NET-021 gained an extra step to verify Poseidon’s root CA hash against the baseline, and we added a mandatory pre-change meeting for any service cert updates involving IAM consumers."}
{"ts": "152:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Before we wrap, I want to touch on a specific cross-system dependency scenario. How did the last Poseidon Networking policy update affect Aegis IAM's mTLS enforcement?"}
{"ts": "152:08", "speaker": "E", "text": "When Poseidon pushed the mTLS policy update under RFC-951, our service-to-service auth modules had to refresh their CA trust bundles. We found that one legacy Orion Edge Gateway node was still using an outdated cert path, leading to failed handshakes until we rolled back that node temporarily."}
{"ts": "152:24", "speaker": "I", "text": "So that incident bridged both Aegis IAM and Orion Edge Gateway. What process did you follow to validate that the rollback didn't weaken security?"}
{"ts": "152:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "We followed the conditional rollback procedure in RUN-NET-042, which mandates maintaining the prior mTLS cipher suites while revalidating cert fingerprints against the approved hash list in SEC-HASH-23. That way, we preserved encryption and mutual auth even during rollback."}
{"ts": "152:49", "speaker": "I", "text": "And did you capture that as a formal post-incident review?"}
{"ts": "152:53", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, PIR-24-019. It included packet capture evidence, audit logs from IAM's token issuer, and Poseidon’s mTLS handshake debug output. The insights fed into an RFC amendment to tighten backward compatibility checks."}
{"ts": "153:08", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. In terms of threat modeling, how would you classify this? Is it more of an availability risk or also a confidentiality angle?"}
{"ts": "153:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "Primarily availability—a failed handshake blocks service calls. But, if misconfigured, it could downgrade ciphers, thus confidentiality. In our STRIDE matrix for IAM integrations, we mapped it under both Denial of Service and Information Disclosure as secondary."}
{"ts": "153:32", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given that, did you adjust any SLAs or SLOs as a result?"}
{"ts": "153:37", "speaker": "E", "text": "We tightened the mTLS handshake success SLO from 99.5% to 99.8% for critical inter-service paths, documented in SLA-IAM-SEC-1. That was paired with a 2‑hour MTTR target for cert mismatch incidents."}
{"ts": "153:51", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching gears, can you recall a recent case where IAM's JIT access provisioning conflicted with a downstream system's caching logic?"}
{"ts": "153:59", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in March, Helios Data Lake had a 15‑minute auth token cache. Our JIT tokens expired in 10 minutes per POL-SEC-001. That mismatch caused failed queries. We coordinated via ticket INC-HEL-442 to align cache invalidation with token TTL."}
{"ts": "154:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "And in terms of risk, did you consider lengthening the JIT token lifetime?"}
{"ts": "154:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "We considered it under RFC-988, but evidence from last quarter's red team (REP-RED-24Q1) showed that shorter tokens reduced lateral movement opportunities. We opted to fix the cache logic instead, accepting minor dev cost over increased exposure."}
{"ts": "154:37", "speaker": "I", "text": "That seems like a clear security-over-convenience choice. How did you communicate the residual risk after the fix?"}
{"ts": "154:44", "speaker": "E", "text": "We issued a residual risk memo RR-24-HELIOS stating that token theft window remains ≤10 minutes. It went to the security steering group with log sampling stats and a probability-impact chart, so stakeholders could see the quantitative trade-off."}
{"ts": "160:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you described the mechanics of RB-IAM-075. I'd like to shift to cross-system dependencies. Can you outline which other internal platforms are currently consuming Aegis IAM for authentication?"}
{"ts": "160:06", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, at present we have Orion Edge Gateway, Poseidon Networking services, and the Helios Data Lake all relying on Aegis IAM as their primary auth provider. Each has slightly different trust boundaries; for example, Orion runs in a semi-isolated DMZ segment, so the token validation path is routed through an API proxy with limited claims exposure."}
{"ts": "160:17", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how do you adjust policies to those varying trust boundaries without creating conflicting enforcement points?"}
{"ts": "160:23", "speaker": "E", "text": "We maintain a policy matrix, updated quarterly, that maps resource sensitivity to enforcement level. For Orion, mTLS is enforced at both ingress and egress, with claims minimization per POL-SEC-005. For Helios, we allow broader claim sets but require additional JIT approval for high-sensitivity datasets."}
{"ts": "160:35", "speaker": "I", "text": "Can you give me a concrete example where a change in IAM impacted Orion's operations?"}
{"ts": "160:41", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure, in RFC-903 phase two, we rotated the signing keys for JWTs. Orion's proxy was still pinned to the old key set due to a missed update in their config repo. This caused a 17-minute outage until the proxy was redeployed with the correct JWKS endpoint."}
{"ts": "160:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "How was that caught so quickly?"}
{"ts": "161:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "Our synthetic transaction monitor for SSO to Orion tripped SLA-OPS-012 within two minutes. Runbook RB-OR-041 instructed the on-call to verify JWKS reachability, which pinpointed the stale config."}
{"ts": "161:11", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let's connect that to Poseidon Networking—how do you validate that their service-to-service mTLS policies are enforced for IAM traffic?"}
{"ts": "161:17", "speaker": "E", "text": "We run quarterly mutual TLS drills, documented in TST-MTLS-004. For Aegis IAM, we capture packet traces at the Poseidon ingress to verify the server cert CN matches 'iam.novereon.internal' and that the client cert chains to our internal CA. Any deviation triggers a Sev-2 ticket."}
{"ts": "161:31", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching gears to incident response, in the last IAM breach simulation, what evidence did you focus on collecting?"}
{"ts": "161:37", "speaker": "E", "text": "We gathered full auth logs from the last 48 hours, correlated with the token issuance service's debug output, and snapshots of the RBAC policy store at T-minus 5, 15, and 30 minutes from the simulated compromise. This met the compliance checklist in AUD-IR-021."}
{"ts": "161:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "And post-simulation, how were those learnings integrated into updates?"}
{"ts": "161:55", "speaker": "E", "text": "We amended RB-IAM-075 to include pre-emptive policy store snapshots when a token anomaly alert fires. RFC-927 was raised to automate that via our runbook orchestration tool."}
{"ts": "162:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, let's talk about an upcoming decision—I've heard there's debate over tightening JIT token lifetimes from 30 minutes to 10. What's the trade-off?"}
{"ts": "162:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Reducing to 10 minutes would cut potential misuse windows by two-thirds, which is significant in threat models involving stolen tokens. However, Ops teams using Helios for data pulls report that complex queries can exceed 10 minutes, causing token expiry mid-operation. Our evidence from HEL-QRY-778 shows a 14% failure rate in that scenario, so the risk vs. continuity balance is still under review."}
{"ts": "161:35", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned POL-SEC-001 alignment—could you expand on how you validate that in the day-to-day operations, especially for JIT tokens that expire within minutes?"}
{"ts": "161:41", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, so every JIT issuance event triggers a policy check pipeline in our Aegis Control Plane. We run the token request through a ruleset codified in the 'LP-JIT.yaml' template, and then we log the decision in SECLOG. The compliance team reviews a random sample weekly against POL-SEC-001 criteria."}
{"ts": "161:54", "speaker": "I", "text": "And what happens when a request fails that check? Do you have an automated denial or is there a human in the loop?"}
{"ts": "162:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "It's automated denial. The requester sees a '403-LP' code. In parallel, a ticket is spawned in SEC-TKT with metadata, so if it's a legitimate business case, a privileged approver can review it under RFC-Override policy."}
{"ts": "162:13", "speaker": "I", "text": "I see. Switching gears—how do you integrate threat modeling into these policies? I'm thinking specifically about changes from RFC-903."}
{"ts": "162:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "For RFC-903, which introduced delegated token scopes, we extended our STRIDE-based threat models. We ran attack surface mapping sessions with both IAM and Poseidon Networking teams to ensure mTLS channel binding would mitigate replay or man-in-the-middle attacks."}
{"ts": "162:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did that involve any changes to the Poseidon mTLS policies themselves?"}
{"ts": "162:41", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, the service-to-service policies in Poseidon were tightened. We mandated mutual authentication for all Aegis-bound requests, with a certificate rotation cycle reduced from 90 to 45 days. This was documented in NET-POL-045."}
{"ts": "162:56", "speaker": "I", "text": "That’s a significant reduction. Any operational pain points from that change?"}
{"ts": "163:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "Initially, yes—some Orion Edge Gateway instances failed the cert renewal due to clock drift. We had to push an emergency patch—ORB-CLKSYNC—through their ops team and updated the runbook 'mTLS-Handshake-Troubleshooting.md'."}
{"ts": "163:17", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. And in terms of vulnerability management, how did you track those handshake failures?"}
{"ts": "163:22", "speaker": "E", "text": "They were tracked in our VulnTrack system under VULN-2024-118. We classify such issues as 'High' because they effectively block enforcement of trust boundaries if left unresolved."}
{"ts": "163:33", "speaker": "I", "text": "Stepping back, if such a vulnerability was exploited, what’s your approach to limiting blast radius for compromised privileged tokens?"}
{"ts": "163:40", "speaker": "E", "text": "We enforce per-resource scoping and ephemeral lifetimes—max 10 minutes—for high-privilege tokens. Additionally, we have anomaly detection in the Access Monitor service; if it sees unusual geolocation or volume, it triggers RB-IAM-075 emergency revocation workflow."}
{"ts": "163:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "So ultimately, what residual risk do you communicate to stakeholders after such mitigations?"}
{"ts": "164:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "We present a quantified risk score using our internal RISK-SCR methodology—combining likelihood from threat intel feeds and impact from asset classification. For example, after RB-IAM-075 events, residual risk for privileged token abuse dropped from 0.42 to 0.17 on our 0–1 scale."}
{"ts": "162:07", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned updating RFCs after incidents—can you expand on how those updates are vetted before adoption?"}
{"ts": "162:13", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. Once we draft the RFC update—say, after RB-IAM-075—we push it through the IAM Change Advisory Board. They check alignment with POL-SEC-001 and our SLA-Security-02. There's a peer review plus a simulation in our staging cluster to ensure no regressions in the SSO and RBAC enforcement points."}
{"ts": "162:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "And is staging fully representative of production in terms of integrations?"}
{"ts": "162:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "Almost. We mirror the critical auth flows with Orion Edge Gateway and Poseidon Networking's mTLS stack. We don't replicate every client system, but for high-risk changes, we do trigger test calls to all priority-tier consumers as defined in DEP-List-Auth-2024."}
{"ts": "162:49", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of Poseidon, how do you verify mTLS enforcement remains intact when IAM pushes new certs?"}
{"ts": "162:54", "speaker": "E", "text": "We run CertSync job logs through our mTLSValidator script from RUN-MTLS-009. It cross-checks CN and SAN fields against the trust store. If any mismatch appears, an automated PagerDuty alert is raised under INC-MTLS-Alert profile."}
{"ts": "163:08", "speaker": "I", "text": "Have you had any incidents triggered by that validator recently?"}
{"ts": "163:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, one in early Q3. A Poseidon node had an outdated intermediate CA. The validator caught it within 3 minutes of deploy. We quarantined the node per NET-ISO-004 and rotated its certs before rejoining the mesh."}
{"ts": "163:27", "speaker": "I", "text": "Good catch. Now, considering the dependency chain from IAM to Orion, what blast radius modeling have you done for a compromised privileged token?"}
{"ts": "163:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "We map token scopes to service account roles in both systems. Using ThreatModel-TKN-2024, we simulated a token leak into Orion staging. The model showed the leak could only access telemetry read endpoints due to scoped RBAC. JIT expiry at 10 minutes limited exposure further."}
{"ts": "163:49", "speaker": "I", "text": "And do you ever adjust JIT expiry based on operational load or risk posture?"}
{"ts": "163:54", "speaker": "E", "text": "Rarely. We have a runbook, RB-JIT-Config, that allows shortening expiry during heightened threat levels—like SEC-ALERT-Red. Increasing expiry is only permitted under CAB-approved maintenance windows to avoid violating least privilege."}
{"ts": "164:10", "speaker": "I", "text": "Understood. Could you detail how incident learnings about mTLS were shared beyond the IAM team?"}
{"ts": "164:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "We held a cross-project postmortem with Poseidon and Orion teams. The finding about intermediate CA expiry was added to their pre-deploy checklist, and we updated the shared Runbook-RB-MTLS-PreCheck v3.2. It’s now a gate in their CI/CD pipelines."}
{"ts": "164:30", "speaker": "I", "text": "And in terms of risk communication from that event, how did you present residual risk?"}
{"ts": "164:35", "speaker": "E", "text": "We prepared a one-page risk brief for stakeholders, showing the probability drop from 0.15 to 0.02 post-fix, using our RISK-METRICS-2024 model. We also noted remaining exposure in non-critical test nodes, marked for phased upgrade."}
{"ts": "164:43", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned how RB-IAM-075 was applied. I'm curious now—outside of emergencies, how do you handle token lifecycle enforcement, particularly for service accounts with delegated permissions?"}
{"ts": "164:48", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a scheduled token rotation policy defined in RUN-TOK-012, which enforces a 72‑hour TTL for high‑privilege service accounts. It's automated via the Aegis control plane, and any exceptions are logged in the IAM waiver register for audit review."}
{"ts": "164:56", "speaker": "I", "text": "And what triggers a review of those waivers? Is that periodic or event driven?"}
{"ts": "165:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "Both. There's a quarterly scheduled review aligned with AUD‑24 cycles, but also an event‑driven trigger if we detect anomalous token usage via SIG-ANOM‑015 alerts from the security monitoring stack."}
{"ts": "165:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Does that monitoring stack pull directly from Aegis IAM logs or is there an intermediate collector?"}
{"ts": "165:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use an intermediate collector called LogBridge‑X. It normalizes the IAM syslog outputs and enriches them with Poseidon Networking's mTLS handshake data before forwarding to our SIEM."}
{"ts": "165:16", "speaker": "I", "text": "So that enrichment—does it help you correlate cross‑system anomalies, say between Orion Edge Gateway and Aegis?"}
{"ts": "165:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly, that's the multi‑hop correlation. We had a case where an expired mTLS cert on Orion caused repeated failed auth attempts, which the SIEM correlated with IAM's increased token refresh requests, pointing us to a trust boundary misalignment."}
{"ts": "165:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. How was that resolved without breaking Orion's operations?"}
{"ts": "165:32", "speaker": "E", "text": "We applied a temporary trust override documented in RFC‑937‑TEMP, with a strict expiry after 48 hours, while the Orion Networking team regenerated and deployed the correct cert chain."}
{"ts": "165:39", "speaker": "I", "text": "From a risk standpoint, did that override increase your blast radius?"}
{"ts": "165:42", "speaker": "E", "text": "Slightly, yes. The override skipped one layer of cert validation, so in RUN-RISK‑104 we documented the temporary exposure and communicated residual risk to both the SOC and affected product owners."}
{"ts": "165:49", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did you put any compensating controls in place during that window?"}
{"ts": "165:53", "speaker": "E", "text": "We tightened the RBAC scope for Orion's service principal to read‑only operations and enabled additional anomaly detection thresholds in SIG‑ANOM‑015 to alert on any unusual access patterns."}
{"ts": "165:59", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given that trade‑off, would you consider a different approach if a similar trust issue occurs?"}
{"ts": "166:03", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we're evaluating a parallel trust path using ephemeral certs issued via our JIT PKI service, which would allow fixes without disabling validation layers, though it adds complexity to the certificate issuance workflow."}
{"ts": "169:23", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the Poseidon Networking mTLS enforcement—can you clarify how we actually validate that for each consuming service? I’m looking for a concrete procedural step, not just policy."}
{"ts": "169:40", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. In the current operate phase, our validation is done using the PN-VAL-221 script, which runs nightly against the Aegis IAM service registry. It compares the cert fingerprints in Poseidon's CA with what's registered in IAM's trust store. If a mismatch is found, the job raises a P3 ticket under the SEC-QA project. This process is cross-referenced in runbook RB-PN-004."}
{"ts": "170:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "And have we had mismatches flagged recently?"}
{"ts": "170:14", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in early May we saw two mismatches. One was the Orion Edge Gateway staging cluster still presenting an outdated cert after a Poseidon CA rotation. The other was a dev instance of the Atlas API. Both were resolved within the SLA of 48 hours defined in SLA-SEC-02."}
{"ts": "170:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "When those mismatches occur, do we take any preventative containment action, or just log and fix?"}
{"ts": "170:44", "speaker": "E", "text": "Containment is immediate for prod-facing endpoints—we temporarily disable the service account in IAM, effectively cutting off SSO for that endpoint until the cert is corrected. In staging or dev, we only log and notify due to lower impact and different trust boundaries."}
{"ts": "171:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching gears: how do you handle trust boundaries when a new Novereon project onboards to Aegis IAM?"}
{"ts": "171:18", "speaker": "E", "text": "We apply the ONB-IAM-010 checklist, which includes data flow mapping, classification of exchanged attributes, and a trust score computed using our internal TRS-Calc tool. Projects with a score below 0.8 require additional isolation—like separate IdP tenants or stricter RBAC scopes."}
{"ts": "171:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "Can you give me a case where that trust score led to a different architecture?"}
{"ts": "171:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, when Helios Data Lake integrated last quarter, its trust score was 0.72 due to ingestion of unverified external datasets. We deployed a dedicated IAM tenant with limited federation to core systems, and mandated JIT access via expiring privilege tokens."}
{"ts": "172:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "Alright. For threat modeling—how do you connect findings from RFC-903 with live operational monitoring?"}
{"ts": "172:28", "speaker": "E", "text": "We took the STRIDE threats identified in RFC-903's review phase and mapped them to detection rules in our SIEM. For example, the 'Elevation of Privilege via stale role bindings' threat translates to rule DET-IAM-07, which flags any role binding older than 30 days without reapproval. This linkage is documented in SEC-MAP-903-A."}
{"ts": "172:54", "speaker": "I", "text": "Have those detections caught anything actionable so far?"}
{"ts": "173:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "One notable case in June: DET-IAM-07 triggered for a contractor account that still had elevated DBAdmin role 45 days after project end. We revoked immediately under RB-IAM-075 protocol and initiated a post-mortem, PM-075-2024-06."}
{"ts": "173:24", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, looking forward, what’s the main trade-off you’re grappling with on the next JIT provisioning update?"}
{"ts": "173:38", "speaker": "E", "text": "The crux is between reducing token TTL from 4 hours to 1 hour to shrink attack window, versus the operational cost of increased re-auths for high-frequency tasks. Our evidence—Ticket ANA-JIT-2024-11—shows a predicted 18% productivity drop for data engineering teams. We’re preparing a risk brief for the Change Advisory Board to decide whether to pilot the shorter TTL in low-criticality domains first."}
{"ts": "176:43", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the Poseidon Networking mTLS policies—can you outline exactly how Aegis IAM validates those in live traffic scenarios?"}
{"ts": "176:53", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we have a dedicated validation job in our CI/CD pipeline that deploys a test service pair, forcing an mTLS handshake using the Poseidon root CA. In production, we sample 0.1% of service-to-service auth calls and run them through the 'TLS-VER-509' check defined in runbook RB-NET-044."}
{"ts": "177:12", "speaker": "I", "text": "And if that sampled verification fails? What’s the immediate control?"}
{"ts": "177:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "The control plane flags it in Grafana with alert code ALR-IAM-098, and the IAM gateway automatically downgrades trust to 'external' for that service endpoint, forcing re-authentication via token exchange. This limits the blast radius to that microservice until we remediate."}
{"ts": "177:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "Can you give me one concrete case where that happened?"}
{"ts": "177:40", "speaker": "E", "text": "In March, ticket INC-NET-2024-0315 captured a failure between Orion Edge Gateway and the Reporting API. The Poseidon cert on the Reporting side had expired. The IAM gateway enforced the downgrade, and we saw only a brief delay for JIT token issuance."}
{"ts": "177:59", "speaker": "I", "text": "Was that incident linked to any RFC adjustments?"}
{"ts": "178:03", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, RFC-912 was opened to change our cert rotation interval from 90 to 60 days for high-trust services, and we added automated expiry alerts into RB-CERT-010."}
{"ts": "178:18", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching gears—what’s your process for integrating threat model findings into the IAM change backlog?"}
{"ts": "178:23", "speaker": "E", "text": "We run quarterly threat modeling sprints, codename 'Aegis Scan', mapping STRIDE categories to existing IAM components. Findings are logged as SEC-BUG items in Jira with severity scoring per POL-RISK-002. Product owners must link acceptance criteria in their backlog items to at least one mitigated threat from that list."}
{"ts": "178:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do you cross-check that mitigation in other systems isn't compromised by IAM changes?"}
{"ts": "178:47", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have an integration test suite in our staging environment which spins up dependent projects—Orion, Poseidon, and Helios Data Lake—and reruns their top ten auth-related regression tests. Failures block the IAM release pipeline until resolved."}
{"ts": "179:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given these tight couplings, what’s your biggest residual risk right now?"}
{"ts": "179:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "Residual risk is mainly around legacy service accounts in Helios that can't yet adopt JIT. They have static credentials, and while we’ve put them behind IP allowlists and anomaly detection, they still present a higher risk profile documented in RISK-REG-Hel-14."}
{"ts": "179:27", "speaker": "I", "text": "And your mitigation roadmap for that?"}
{"ts": "179:31", "speaker": "E", "text": "Phase-out is planned in two quarters as part of RFC-950. We’re building a compatibility shim that will allow those services to request ephemeral tokens without breaking their batch jobs, tested already in DEV-HELIOS-028."}
{"ts": "184:43", "speaker": "I", "text": "Before we wrap, I’d like to revisit cross-system dependencies; specifically, how Aegis IAM interacts with the Poseidon Networking mTLS layer in practice."}
{"ts": "184:56", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. Every service-to-service call that passes through Aegis-authenticated channels is wrapped in Poseidon's mTLS policy. We validate the cert chain against our internal CA defined in RUN-MTLS-014 and log any CN mismatches under the SEC-AUD-logs."}
{"ts": "185:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "And do you have automated tests to verify those CNs align with IAM role scopes?"}
{"ts": "185:23", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we run nightly integration tests—these simulate Orion Edge Gateway calls with varying cert identities. If a cert CN maps to a role not permitted in IAM's RBAC matrix, the call is dropped and flagged in the nightly CI report."}
{"ts": "185:44", "speaker": "I", "text": "Thinking multi-hop: When Orion fails on cert validation, how is that surfaced back to IAM operators?"}
{"ts": "185:55", "speaker": "E", "text": "It’s a two-step signal: Orion sends an event to the Central Event Bus tagged EVT-ID-4012, which Aegis' monitor agent subscribes to. That triggers a runbook step (RUN-ORION-FAIL-05) for IAM ops to assess whether it’s a cert issue or a role assignment drift."}
{"ts": "186:17", "speaker": "I", "text": "So you’re correlating network-layer trust failures with IAM's logical access records."}
{"ts": "186:25", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. That correlation was introduced after RFC-903 testing revealed false positives if only one layer was considered. Now, both must agree before marking it as a critical block."}
{"ts": "186:43", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching gears—how does that interplay affect your incident containment window, say if a privileged token is compromised?"}
{"ts": "186:54", "speaker": "E", "text": "It shortens it: with both mTLS and RBAC failing fast, mean time to containment dropped from 14 to 9 minutes in our Q3 drills. The layered signals reduce uncertainty, so we can revoke tokens via RB-IAM-075 faster."}
{"ts": "187:13", "speaker": "I", "text": "That’s a tangible benefit. Now, what trade-offs did you encounter integrating those two alert streams?"}
{"ts": "187:22", "speaker": "E", "text": "One was alert fatigue. Merging streams increased noise. We mitigated by adding a severity correlation rule—if both IAM and Poseidon report within 500ms on the same service ID, it counts as one high-priority alert; otherwise, they’re logged as separate low-priority events."}
{"ts": "187:45", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did that require any SLA adjustments for downstream teams?"}
{"ts": "187:52", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, the SLA for Orion support was revised in SLA-ORION-06 to allow 15 minutes to respond to joint alerts instead of 10, acknowledging the deduplication process."}
{"ts": "188:08", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given those changes, how do you quantify residual risk now?"}
{"ts": "188:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "We factor in the reduced containment time against the slightly longer SLA. Risk models in our GRC tool show a net 12% improvement in risk score, documented in RSK-MOD-2024-09, which we circulated to stakeholders last month."}
{"ts": "192:43", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned that RB-IAM-075 was triggered twice this quarter. For my understanding, in those cases, did the revocation process impact any dependent microservices unexpectedly?"}
{"ts": "192:57", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in one of those instances the emergency revocation cascaded into a temporary auth failure for the Helios Data Lake ingestion jobs. The service accounts there had not been properly flagged in the exemption list per RUN-IAM-044, so their tokens were invalidated alongside the compromised admin account."}
{"ts": "193:21", "speaker": "I", "text": "So this was a case where the blast radius extended due to a misapplied exemption policy? How was that handled in real time?"}
{"ts": "193:35", "speaker": "E", "text": "We followed the contingency steps in section 5.3 of RB-IAM-075. That meant prioritizing re-issuance of scoped service tokens for those ingestion jobs, while keeping the compromised principal revoked. Ops restored those jobs within 17 minutes, which was still within the 20-minute SLA specified in SLA-AEG-OP-02."}
{"ts": "193:59", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given that SLA, was there any discussion about automating the exemption tagging to avoid human error?"}
{"ts": "194:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Absolutely. We proposed an automation in RFC-921 that hooks into Poseidon Networking's service registry to auto-tag IAM principals tied to critical ingestion paths. That draft is in peer review now, because the cross-team dependency needs explicit sign-off from the Poseidon maintainers."}
{"ts": "194:38", "speaker": "I", "text": "Shifting to vulnerability management—how are you tracking CVEs in the third-party SSO libraries used by Aegis?"}
{"ts": "194:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "We ingest CVE feeds into our Vulnerability Dashboard via VulnTrack-Cloud, and we've configured custom filters for the ID ranges affecting the SAML and OIDC libraries in use. When a match is found, it opens a ticket in JIRA with the component owner auto-assigned, referencing the relevant PROD-IAM asset ID."}
{"ts": "195:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Have there been any recent high-severity findings?"}
{"ts": "195:23", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, CVE-2024-7781 in the OIDC parsing library. That was rated critical. We hot-patched our container images within 8 hours of disclosure, validated via HASH-SIG-OK in the deployment logs, and closed the ticket under CHG-2024-311 after regression testing."}
{"ts": "195:47", "speaker": "I", "text": "In terms of cross-system dependencies, can you give me a multi-hop example where a change in IAM indirectly affected a downstream system?"}
{"ts": "196:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. Last month, a change in Aegis's token expiration defaults—from 60 minutes to 30 minutes for elevated roles—caused Orion Edge Gateway sessions to drop mid-transfer. Orion was relying on those tokens indirectly through the Artemis API Gateway, which cached them without refresh logic. That link across three subsystems wasn't flagged during the change impact analysis."}
{"ts": "196:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "And the mitigation?"}
{"ts": "196:31", "speaker": "E", "text": "We rolled back the default to 60 minutes temporarily and created RFC-927 to add proactive token refresh in Artemis. That RFC includes a joint test plan with Orion's QA to verify stability before we attempt the shorter expiry again."}
{"ts": "196:54", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking ahead, what's the biggest trade-off you foresee for JIT access provisioning in the next quarter?"}
{"ts": "197:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "We're weighing the security benefit of per-request approval for all admin JIT sessions against the operational cost in on-call engineer fatigue. Evidence from the last three incidents—INC-24-441, -452, and -467—shows average response times increased by 14% when manual approvals were enforced. The decision will hinge on whether automation can offset that latency without weakening the approval chain."}
{"ts": "200:43", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the Poseidon Networking mTLS enforcement—can you walk me through how you validate that for every microservice consuming Aegis IAM tokens?"}
{"ts": "201:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure, we run a nightly automated test suite defined in RN-POS-041 that spins up ephemeral service pairs with known cert chains. It then attempts both valid and tampered mTLS handshakes. Any deviation from the policy in SEC-MTLS-002 triggers an alert in our SOC dashboard."}
{"ts": "201:31", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how do you ensure those alerts are actionable and not just noise?"}
{"ts": "201:46", "speaker": "E", "text": "We correlate them with service registry metadata from the Aegis IAM audit logs, so if a failing service is in a non-prod namespace we downgrade severity. This layering was added after incident INC-PE-119 where we overreacted to a staging misconfig."}
{"ts": "202:11", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of incidents, can you give an example where an IAM change inadvertently impacted Orion Edge Gateway?"}
{"ts": "202:29", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, RFC-903 introduced a stricter token expiry for JIT admin roles. Orion's firmware update service relied on a longer-lived token for bulk updates. The rollout caused mid-update failures, logged under INC-OEG-202. We had to add a temporary compatibility claim to the token until Orion patched their client."}
{"ts": "202:57", "speaker": "I", "text": "Was that compatibility claim documented anywhere for future reference?"}
{"ts": "203:09", "speaker": "E", "text": "It was appended to the exception list in RUN-IAM-EXC-12, with a sunset date agreed under SLA-OEG-01. That way we had both operational traceability and a clear removal timeline."}
{"ts": "203:31", "speaker": "I", "text": "Good. Now in terms of vulnerability management, how are CVEs in third-party IAM components prioritized?"}
{"ts": "203:46", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use a hybrid score: base CVSS from the vendor, multiplied by an internal exposure factor from our Aegis IAM threat model. For example, CVE-24-7711 in the JWT parsing lib was only reachable via an admin path, so we scheduled it for the next sprint instead of an immediate hotfix."}
{"ts": "204:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "Do you ever override that schedule for compliance reasons?"}
{"ts": "204:25", "speaker": "E", "text": "If POL-SEC-004 'Critical Patch within 48h' applies—like for remote code execution in auth flows—yes. We had that with CVE-24-7800 and cut a hotfix branch, validated via RUN-IAM-HF-07, and deployed through our blue-green clusters overnight."}
{"ts": "204:53", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking ahead, what are the trade-offs you're considering for the new JIT provisioning workflow in RFC-915?"}
{"ts": "205:09", "speaker": "E", "text": "The main trade-off is between provisioning speed and the depth of pre-access vetting. We can preload context from HRIS feeds to speed up access grants, but that increases the risk of stale data being used. The alternative is live vetting via the IAM policy engine, which adds 2–3 seconds latency per request."}
{"ts": "205:37", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how are you quantifying that residual risk for stakeholders this time?"}
{"ts": "205:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "We model it in our RiskCalc tool as additional probability of unauthorized access per 10k JIT grants. For the HRIS preload path, it’s 0.08%, versus 0.02% for live vetting. That delta is visualized in the stakeholder deck with both cost and latency impact so they can make an informed decision."}
{"ts": "208:43", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned that RFC-903 introduced some changes to the trust boundary handling. Can you explain, in more operational terms, how those changes were rolled out without breaching the SLA for Aegis IAM?"}
{"ts": "208:51", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. RFC-903 proposed segmenting the policy enforcement points into three logical tiers. We rolled it out using a blue-green deployment model for the enforcement microservices, each behind its own mTLS-enabled ingress, so that existing sessions weren't dropped. Our SLA-SEC-99 allows for up to 90 seconds of degraded auth throughput, and we stayed within 48 seconds during switchover."}
{"ts": "208:59", "speaker": "I", "text": "And did you have to coordinate with Poseidon Networking for that ingress configuration?"}
{"ts": "209:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, exactly. Poseidon enforces the service-to-service mTLS policies. We had to submit a change request—CHG-445—to align cipher suites with IAM's updated Java TLS stack. That was synced in their maintenance window to avoid handshake mismatches."}
{"ts": "209:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "So that’s a multi-team dependency. Did you document that in the dependency runbook?"}
{"ts": "209:21", "speaker": "E", "text": "We did. Runbook RB-IAM-DEP-003 now has a section called 'Poseidon Coordination Steps', listing required lead times, test endpoints for pre-flight checks, and a rollback procedure if mTLS fails."}
{"ts": "209:29", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there any incidents where that dependency caused a delay or incident?"}
{"ts": "209:36", "speaker": "E", "text": "Once—ticket INC-2024-118—Poseidon pushed a cipher deprecation ahead of schedule, which broke token introspection for Orion Edge Gateway. We had to temporarily whitelist their old cipher in Aegis IAM to restore service while they reverted."}
{"ts": "209:48", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. What evidence did you collect from that for audit purposes?"}
{"ts": "209:54", "speaker": "E", "text": "We preserved ingress logs from both IAM and Poseidon, TLS handshake traces, and the CHG-445 approval trail. All were attached to the post-incident review PIR-2024-07 and cross-referenced against POL-SEC-001 to ensure no lasting policy violation."}
{"ts": "210:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "Shifting gears—how do you balance rapid patching of IAM components with the risk of disrupting dependent services?"}
{"ts": "210:13", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use a risk matrix based on CVSS score and exploitability in our environment. For high-risk patches, we spin up a full integration environment with Orion and Poseidon staging to run regression against their APIs. This sometimes delays patching by 24–48 hours, but avoids a much larger blast radius."}
{"ts": "210:26", "speaker": "I", "text": "Have you ever had to accept a period of elevated risk because of that delay?"}
{"ts": "210:32", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in March we had CVE-AX77 in the SSO broker library. We risk-accepted for 36 hours with additional WAF rules in place, documented under RSK-2024-03, because Orion's batch processing API couldn't handle the broker change without modification."}
{"ts": "210:45", "speaker": "I", "text": "And stakeholders were comfortable with that?"}
{"ts": "210:51", "speaker": "E", "text": "After we presented the layered mitigation—WAF filters, reduced token TTLs, and heightened monitoring—they signed off in the risk acceptance form. The residual risk was quantified as a 0.2% increase in potential unauthorized accesses over the 36-hour window."}
{"ts": "216:43", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the alternate JIT provisioning designs that were rejected. Could you expand on the specific operational risks that outweighed the potential security benefits?"}
{"ts": "216:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "Right, so one of the more radical designs—documented in RFC-912—suggested ephemeral service accounts spun up per task. Theoretically, it reduced long-lived credential exposure, but in practice our orchestration layer in Aegis IAM would have been issuing 8–10x more token requests per hour. That load, per STAB-OPS-07 projections, would have tripped our latency SLA with dependent systems like Orion Edge Gateway."}
{"ts": "217:07", "speaker": "I", "text": "So you're saying the throughput hit would have impacted Orion's real-time gateway handshakes?"}
{"ts": "217:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. Orion Edge does mTLS handshake plus SSO assertion within 250ms budget. The added IAM provisioning delay—modelled at ~80ms—would push several flows over-budget. In a live pilot, we saw handshake retries spike 15%."}
{"ts": "217:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "And that would cascade to user-facing latency?"}
{"ts": "217:32", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, particularly for federated partners entering through Poseidon Networking gateways. Those have stricter enforcement of service-to-service mTLS, so any delay in cert exchange plus IAM token validation is magnified."}
{"ts": "217:46", "speaker": "I", "text": "Understood. Given that, how did you document the residual risk when deciding to keep the current JIT model?"}
{"ts": "217:53", "speaker": "E", "text": "We used our Risk Register, entry RR-2024-019. It quantifies that while token lifetime is 5 minutes, the blast radius is limited via RBAC scoping. We attached simulation logs from SIM-IAM-05 and a note that compensating controls—like anomaly detection in SentinelWatch—offset the slightly longer credential lifetime."}
{"ts": "218:12", "speaker": "I", "text": "And stakeholders were comfortable with that trade-off?"}
{"ts": "218:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "After two review cycles, yes. The Ops Director signed off on 2024-05-14, with the proviso that we revisit if token compromise incidents exceed 2 per quarter."}
{"ts": "218:27", "speaker": "I", "text": "Have you had to invoke that threshold yet?"}
{"ts": "218:30", "speaker": "E", "text": "Not yet. Q2 saw one privileged token alert in SentinelWatch, quickly revoked per RB-IAM-075. Forensic evidence—packet captures, IAM audit logs—was attached to INC-2451 for compliance."}
{"ts": "218:45", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given that, would you consider re-opening RFC-912 if the orchestration layer's efficiency improves?"}
{"ts": "218:51", "speaker": "E", "text": "Definitely. Our roadmap has ORCH-OPT-11 slated for Q4, which could cut token issuance latency by 60%. If the pilot meets that metric, the RFC can be revisited with updated load testing."}
{"ts": "219:04", "speaker": "I", "text": "So in the meantime, your runbooks reflect the current model and thresholds?"}
{"ts": "219:09", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, Runbook RB-IAM-101 was updated 2024-06-02 to embed those thresholds and link directly to the risk register entries, so on-call staff have context during incident triage."}
{"ts": "225:23", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned RB-IAM-075; before we close, I'd like to pivot to how those learnings influence cross‑project dependencies, especially with Poseidon Networking. Can you link that for me?"}
{"ts": "225:31", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. After the emergency revocation, we updated the mTLS enforcement section in Poseidon’s service mesh runbook — that’s RN-POS-112 — to ensure tokens revoked in Aegis propagate within 30 seconds to all microservices. This required coordination between IAM’s webhook system and Poseidon's sidecar configurations."}
{"ts": "225:44", "speaker": "I", "text": "So you’re saying a procedural change in IAM forced a technical adjustment in the networking layer?"}
{"ts": "225:48", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. The webhook payload format was extended to include a cryptographic proof for revocation. Poseidon's proxy filter had to be updated to parse and validate that proof; without it, stale privileges could persist beyond SLA‑NET‑015's permissible window."}
{"ts": "225:59", "speaker": "I", "text": "And this change — was it tracked formally via an RFC?"}
{"ts": "226:03", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, RFC‑947 documented both sides: IAM’s webhook schema change and Poseidon’s filter logic update. We even ran a joint tabletop exercise to simulate a delayed revocation and measure blast radius reduction."}
{"ts": "226:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "How did Orion Edge Gateway factor into that test, if at all?"}
{"ts": "226:19", "speaker": "E", "text": "We included Orion because it consumes Aegis tokens for edge telemetry ingestion. During the exercise, we intentionally delayed token revocation across one Orion cluster to validate that Poseidon's updated mTLS handshake would refuse the stale token — it did, cutting off only the compromised node rather than the entire cluster."}
