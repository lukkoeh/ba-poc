{"ts": "00:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let's start directly — can you explain how our current RBAC model in Aegis IAM enforces the enterprise security policy POL-SEC-001?"}
{"ts": "04:35", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. The RBAC model is tiered into role groups mapped against POL-SEC-001’s minimum privilege clauses. Each role is bound via our policy-as-code repository to explicit resource claims, and the enforcement layer in Aegis integrates with our SSO broker to validate JWT claims at login, ensuring no user can exceed their assigned privileges even during JIT (just-in-time) elevation."}
{"ts": "09:10", "speaker": "I", "text": "And what about RFC-903 — how does that influence your policy-as-code deployments?"}
{"ts": "13:25", "speaker": "E", "text": "RFC-903 dictates the standardized notation for hierarchical role inheritance we follow. In practice, that means our YAML policies define parent-child relationships explicitly, which our CI pipeline validates before merge. It reduces drift between declared and effective permissions."}
{"ts": "18:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Walk me through the onboarding of a new app into the SSO ecosystem."}
{"ts": "22:42", "speaker": "E", "text": "First, we complete the APP-SSO-ONB checklist — metadata ingestion, SAML/OIDC config, mapping app-specific roles to enterprise roles. Then we schedule a staging environment test, where the app is subjected to our automated access validation suite before production cutover."}
{"ts": "27:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching gears — RB-IAM-075. Can you walk me through it and how it aligns with SLA obligations?"}
{"ts": "31:58", "speaker": "E", "text": "RB-IAM-075 is our emergency revocation runbook. It specifies a 15-minute SLA from detection to revocation for high-severity compromises. Steps include immediate token blacklist update via Redis cluster, propagation to edge caches, and audit log export to the SEC-EVID archive."}
{"ts": "36:40", "speaker": "I", "text": "What indicators do you monitor to trigger that revocation flow?"}
{"ts": "41:22", "speaker": "E", "text": "We look for anomalous login patterns across geo-IP regions, multiple failed MFA attempts within 5 minutes, and Poseidon Networking alerts on suspicious east-west traffic. Any two indicators in combination auto-trigger RB-IAM-075."}
{"ts": "46:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "Can you give me a cross-project example — perhaps how Poseidon misconfig could bypass IAM?"}
{"ts": "50:47", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes. If Poseidon's internal firewall rules are misaligned, an internal service might bypass the IAM proxy layer, authenticating directly on legacy endpoints. That’s why we’ve implemented a dependency check in the Poseidon CI to ensure firewall configs always route through IAM."}
{"ts": "55:30", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how do you coordinate with Orion Edge Gateway to enforce mTLS at both layers?"}
{"ts": "60:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "We share a mutual CA between IAM and Orion. At the Edge, mTLS ensures client cert validation before a request reaches IAM, and IAM performs its own mTLS handshake for internal microservice calls. We align cert rotation schedules via the shared SEC-ROT-PLAN runbook."}
{"ts": "65:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "When IAM tokens are compromised, what's your blast radius consideration across these systems?"}
{"ts": "90:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We map compromised token scopes against our service inventory to identify all potentially impacted apps. For high-scope tokens, we may trigger cascade revocations in dependent systems like Orion and Poseidon. This multi-hop impact analysis is documented in SEC-BLAST-042 and is rehearsed quarterly."}
{"ts": "90:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned aligning RBAC with Poseidon's ACLs and Orion's mTLS. Now, can you walk me through a specific trade-off you made between strict least privilege and keeping users productive?"}
{"ts": "90:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. In Q1 we had an urgent case where our RBAC policies per POL-SEC-001 blocked a DevOps group from accessing a staging cluster for a hotfix. The strict model required two separate approval chains, which would have added four hours downtime. We created a temporary policy override under RFC-903 emergency change path, documented in ticket IAM-URG-221, and set a 6-hour TTL on that permission."}
{"ts": "90:39", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how did you justify that exception in context of compliance?"}
{"ts": "90:47", "speaker": "E", "text": "We referenced RB-IAM-075 which allows for urgent production changes if documented in the emergency access ledger and reviewed within 24 hours. We also collected full audit logs from the Aegis IAM policy-as-code pipeline to show no permanent policy drift occurred."}
{"ts": "91:08", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given conflicting SLAs between IAM and Poseidon Networking, how do you decide which remediation to prioritize when both have incidents?"}
{"ts": "91:21", "speaker": "E", "text": "We apply the blast radius heuristic: the system with the larger immediate security exposure wins priority. For example, in incident SEC-2057, Poseidon's misrouted ACL exposed a subnet to unauthenticated traffic; although IAM tokens were also expiring incorrectly, we focused on Poseidon first because it was a live exposure. This is codified in our cross-project SLA alignment doc OPS-SLA-MAP-v3."}
{"ts": "91:48", "speaker": "I", "text": "How did the AUD-24-Q2 findings influence your access review cadence?"}
{"ts": "91:57", "speaker": "E", "text": "That audit showed 8% of service accounts had stale entitlements. We shifted from quarterly to monthly access reviews for high-privilege roles. We also integrated an automated diff tool into the policy-as-code repo to flag drift against POL-SEC-001 baselines."}
{"ts": "92:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "Post-incident, what KPIs do you monitor to validate improvement?"}
{"ts": "92:29", "speaker": "E", "text": "We track mean time to revoke (MTTRv) for compromised accounts, policy deployment success rate, and number of emergency policy exceptions opened per quarter. For example, after implementing the automated TTLs, MTTRv dropped from 42 minutes to 18 minutes."}
{"ts": "92:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "Describe how vulnerability management outcomes are fed back into IAM hardening."}
{"ts": "93:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "When VulnOps closes a high severity finding, we map any identity-related factors into a hardening backlog in Jira board IAM-HARDEN. For example, CVE-SYN-9921 in Orion's TLS library led us to enforce shorter token lifetimes and enable claim-based revocation triggers."}
{"ts": "93:21", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there any risks in implementing claim-based revocation?"}
{"ts": "93:30", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, primarily around increased load on the revocation service, which in stress tests hit 85% CPU. We mitigated by sharding the revocation list and adding a cache layer. There's also a minor usability hit: some long-running batch jobs are interrupted more often."}
{"ts": "93:52", "speaker": "I", "text": "Do you see that as acceptable?"}
{"ts": "94:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "Given the risk of stale tokens in a compromised environment, yes. We've documented the trade-off and provided batch job owners with guidance on checkpointing so they can resume after a revocation event without data loss. It's in runbook RB-IAM-090, reviewed last month."}
{"ts": "98:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "You've been hinting at conflicting SLAs. Can you walk me through a concrete case where Aegis IAM's SLA clashed with, say, Poseidon Networking's?"}
{"ts": "98:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. In March, Ticket INC-4421, we had a network latency spike in Poseidon. Their SLA allows up to 15 minutes for resolution, but our IAM SLA for authentication is 99.99% availability with 300ms response time. When Poseidon hit 12 minutes of degraded performance, our SSO login latency breached thresholds. We had to decide whether to fail-open or degrade gracefully."}
{"ts": "98:38", "speaker": "I", "text": "And what decision did you take in that situation?"}
{"ts": "98:42", "speaker": "E", "text": "We opted for a controlled degrade — essentially rate-limiting new session inits while keeping token validation paths prioritized. That meant some users saw delays, but we avoided bypassing POL-SEC-001. Evidence from the incident was logged per RUN-IAM-12 to support the post-mortem."}
{"ts": "99:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "Was there pushback from the business on that call?"}
{"ts": "99:09", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, some product owners wanted a temporary fail-open for VIP accounts. But risk assessment RSK-2023-07 had flagged that as unacceptable due to recent audit findings. We used that documented risk to justify our choice in the incident bridge."}
{"ts": "99:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "How did you incorporate what you learned from INC-4421 into continuous improvement?"}
{"ts": "99:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "We updated our dependency mapping in the IAM service manifest to include Poseidon's latency metrics, so the alerting can predict SLA breach earlier. Additionally, we added a runbook section on cross-service degradation patterns, so future incident commanders can act in under 2 minutes."}
{"ts": "99:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let's talk about trade-offs in least privilege versus productivity. Have you ever had to make an exception during urgent production fixes?"}
{"ts": "100:01", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in RFC-1091 we approved Just-In-Time admin elevation for a DB migration that was blocking a financial close. Normally, POL-SEC-001 would have required four-eyes approval, but we used the emergency override in RB-IAM-075. We accepted a 15-minute window of elevated rights, with all actions logged and reviewed within 24 hours."}
{"ts": "100:26", "speaker": "I", "text": "Was that override audited later?"}
{"ts": "100:29", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, AUD-24-Q2 flagged it, but since we had complete session recordings and the change matched the approved RFC, it was marked as compliant with exception protocol. We also tightened the criteria for invoking RB-IAM-075 to require CISO sign-off if risk score exceeds 7."}
{"ts": "100:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given these experiences, how do you balance operational overhead when hardening controls?"}
{"ts": "100:55", "speaker": "E", "text": "We apply a weighted scoring: security impact 50%, user impact 30%, operational cost 20%. For example, when integrating mTLS with Orion Edge Gateway, we staggered rollout by user segment to avoid mass disruption while still reducing token replay risk."}
{"ts": "101:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, what KPIs do you track post-incident to ensure your improvements worked?"}
{"ts": "101:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "We track mean detection time for cross-service degradation, number of emergency overrides per quarter, and percentage of privileged actions with full audit trail. Since INC-4421, detection time dropped from 8 min to under 3, and emergency overrides reduced by 40%."}
{"ts": "114:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned aligning RBAC with POL-SEC-001; can you elaborate on how that enforcement is audited routinely?"}
{"ts": "114:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. We run a quarterly compliance job—scripted as per RUN-COMP-042—that cross‑references the role assignments in Aegis IAM against the baseline policy matrix from POL-SEC-001. Any deviations are flagged into our GRC queue as TCK-SEC-45xx series tickets, and we must remediate them within the 10‑day SLA."}
{"ts": "114:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "And if you onboard a new application into the SSO ecosystem, what's your step-by-step?"}
{"ts": "114:21", "speaker": "E", "text": "We start with RFC-903 alignment—ensuring the app can consume SAML 2.0 or OIDC with our assertion format. Then we define its RBAC mapping in the policy-as-code repo, trigger a staging deployment, validate in pre‑prod with synthetic user accounts, and only then request PROD cutover via CAB form CAB-IAM-092."}
{"ts": "114:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "Good. Now, imagine Poseidon Networking has a misconfigured trust zone—how could that bypass IAM controls?"}
{"ts": "114:43", "speaker": "E", "text": "If Poseidon's zone misconfig allowed unrestricted east‑west traffic, a service could bypass the API gateway’s IAM enforcement and call downstream microservices directly. That's why we have a cross‑project control in RUN-NET-017: we validate mTLS and JWT validation at the service mesh layer, which Poseidon must enforce."}
{"ts": "114:57", "speaker": "I", "text": "So coordination with Orion Edge Gateway—how do you ensure mTLS is enforced at both layers?"}
{"ts": "115:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a shared config template in GIT-CONF-EDGE that defines the certificate authorities and cipher suites. Orion’s ingress rules require mutual TLS before passing to IAM endpoints, and IAM’s own API layer re‑validates the client cert fingerprint, closing any potential trust gap."}
{"ts": "115:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching to incident response—walk me through RB-IAM-075 in an actual revocation scenario."}
{"ts": "115:21", "speaker": "E", "text": "RB-IAM-075 is our emergency revocation runbook. Step one: isolate the actor by disabling their account in the IdP directory. Step two: revoke all active tokens via the Aegis token store API. Step three: trigger an audit event stream to SEC-EVID-QUEUE for later correlation. We must complete steps 1–3 within the 15‑minute SLA."}
{"ts": "115:35", "speaker": "I", "text": "What indicators do you monitor to trigger that emergency revocation?"}
{"ts": "115:40", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have SIEM rules keyed on anomalous login geo‑patterns, sudden privilege escalations outside CAB approvals, and any API call sequences matching IOC-PRIV-ESC-202. Detection of any of those fires a high‑priority TCK-IR-99xx ticket."}
{"ts": "115:52", "speaker": "I", "text": "How about auditability in a high‑pressure incident—how do you preserve it?"}
{"ts": "115:57", "speaker": "E", "text": "Every runbook step has a corresponding log action: disabling an account emits EVT-AUTH-401, token revocation emits EVT-TOKEN-403, all timestamped and immutable in our WORM storage. Even if we shortcut some approvals due to urgency, the evidential trail is intact for post‑incident review."}
{"ts": "116:10", "speaker": "I", "text": "And to close, when IAM tokens are compromised, how do you assess blast radius across systems?"}
{"ts": "116:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "We run a compromise graph analysis: start with token scope from the JWT claims, map to the RBAC roles, then enumerate all services with trust in those roles. If Orion Edge or Poseidon endpoints are in that set, we notify their on‑call per the CROSS-PROJ-ALERT runbook, and we sometimes choose to rotate keys across the whole tenant if lateral movement risk is high."}
{"ts": "116:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned those SLA conflicts. Now, can you walk me through a concrete example where you had to escalate a delay because of Poseidon Networking's latency issues impacting Aegis IAM token validation?"}
{"ts": "116:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, one case was TCK-2384 in our incident tracker. Poseidon's internal DNS resolver misrouted mTLS handshakes, which meant our token introspection endpoint had a 600ms delay. That pushed us beyond the 500ms SLA, so I escalated via the joint OpSec bridge channel, per RB-IAM-092."}
{"ts": "116:38", "speaker": "I", "text": "And during that escalation, did you invoke any temporary policy changes or overrides?"}
{"ts": "116:46", "speaker": "E", "text": "We applied a temporary caching rule for already validated tokens, documented in RFC-903 Appendix D. It was a controlled deviation from POL-SEC-001, approved by the duty IAM architect, with a 2-hour expiry set in the runbook."}
{"ts": "117:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let's pivot to onboarding. Suppose a new analytics app comes in needing SSO. What's your step-by-step?"}
{"ts": "117:14", "speaker": "E", "text": "First, I review its SP metadata for compatibility with our SAML2 and OIDC profiles. Then, per ONB-APP-014, I create a staging integration in our dev IdP, map roles to existing RBAC groups defined in pol-sec config, run automated policy-as-code tests, and finally schedule a cutover with the app team after a successful UAT sign-off."}
{"ts": "117:38", "speaker": "I", "text": "In terms of cross-project dependencies, how do you ensure Orion Edge Gateway enforces mTLS consistently with IAM?"}
{"ts": "117:49", "speaker": "E", "text": "We align cipher suites and cert rotation schedules. Orion's mTLS config is checked against our STS endpoint truststore weekly. If mismatches are detected—say, via check script CHK-MTLS-017—we coordinate a joint deployment window to update both layers simultaneously."}
{"ts": "118:12", "speaker": "I", "text": "What about monitoring? What indicators tell you to trigger an emergency revocation as per RB-IAM-075?"}
{"ts": "118:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "Three main ones: anomalous geo-location in access logs, excessive failed mTLS handshakes, and correlation with threat intel feeds. If two trigger concurrently, RB-IAM-075 mandates immediate revocation and a forensics snapshot of audit logs."}
{"ts": "118:39", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do you balance strict least privilege with developers needing quick fixes in prod?"}
{"ts": "118:47", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use Just-In-Time elevation with an auto-expiry of 30 minutes, captured in ticket form and cross-linked to change records. This mitigates risk while allowing urgent work; the exception is logged for quarterly audit review per AUD-24-Q2 remediation plan."}
{"ts": "119:07", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of AUD-24-Q2, what lasting changes did that audit trigger in your access review cadence?"}
{"ts": "119:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "We moved from semi-annual to quarterly access reviews for all privileged IAM roles. This was codified in POL-SEC-008 Rev 3, and we automated detection of stale JIT grants via the IAM-Review Lambda job."}
{"ts": "119:33", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, when IAM tokens are compromised, what blast radius considerations guide your response?"}
{"ts": "119:42", "speaker": "E", "text": "We assess which services accept those tokens without secondary verification, using our dependency map. Priority one is revoking at the IdP and forcing re-auth on high-sensitivity apps, then coordinating with dependent teams to clear caches and invalidate any session derived from the token."}
{"ts": "124:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you talked about SLA conflicts and risk acceptance. Let's pivot — can you walk me through a concrete example where Poseidon Networking misconfiguration could have bypassed an IAM control in Aegis?"}
{"ts": "124:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. One case we flagged during a joint tabletop was in PN-CONF-217. Poseidon's default route mapping for edge VLANs accidentally exposed a management subnet to the same security zone as an SSO-protected app proxy. Without network segmentation, the mTLS handshake enforced by Aegis IAM could be skipped if the client was already inside that mis-zoned network."}
{"ts": "124:33", "speaker": "I", "text": "So that means the IAM trust boundary was effectively moved inward?"}
{"ts": "124:37", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. We rely on Poseidon's ACLs to define the outer boundary. If those ACLs are too permissive, our RFC-903 compliant policy-as-code doesn't see the threat, because the client appears 'internal'. That's why we added a dependency check in RB-OPS-031 to validate network zone tags before issuing tokens."}
{"ts": "124:56", "speaker": "I", "text": "And in terms of coordination with Orion Edge Gateway, how would you enforce mTLS at both layers?"}
{"ts": "125:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use a dual-cert approach. OEG enforces device-level mTLS at the ingress level, and our Aegis service broker enforces user-context mTLS internally. They share a CA chain documented in CERT-CHAIN-04. The runbook RB-IAM-092 has the step-by-step for rotating both certs to avoid downtime."}
{"ts": "125:26", "speaker": "I", "text": "Moving to blast radius thinking — if IAM tokens are compromised, what is your immediate containment action?"}
{"ts": "125:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "First, trigger EMERG-REVOKE-02, which forces revocation in under 90 seconds per SLA-S-120. Then we invalidate session caches across dependent services via the Kafka-based revocation bus. We also temporarily tighten RBAC roles to minimum until post-mortem confirms no lateral movement."}
{"ts": "125:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "Those sound strict — have you faced pushback from ops teams about productivity hits?"}
{"ts": "126:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, especially during urgent fixes. For instance, during INC-4581, revocation meant the on-call DBAs lost console access mid-fix. We had to execute an exception under POL-SEC-001-E1, logging all elevated commands and limiting the exception to a 30-minute window."}
{"ts": "126:23", "speaker": "I", "text": "So you balance strict least privilege with operational needs using documented exceptions?"}
{"ts": "126:28", "speaker": "E", "text": "Right. And every exception auto-generates an AUD-EXC record, which is reviewed in the bi-weekly security CAB. That allows us to trade off short-term risk for uptime, but with full traceability."}
{"ts": "126:44", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking at evidence and continuous improvement — how did the last AUD-24-Q2 findings influence your access review cadence?"}
{"ts": "126:52", "speaker": "E", "text": "AUD-24-Q2 noted dormant service accounts lingering beyond 45 days. We tightened our runbook RB-REV-010 to run dormant account scans weekly instead of monthly, and integrated the scanner with our JIT access module so accounts auto-expire unless renewed."}
{"ts": "127:12", "speaker": "I", "text": "And what KPIs do you track post-incident to validate improvements?"}
{"ts": "127:18", "speaker": "E", "text": "We track mean revocation time, number of unauthorized access attempts post-mitigation, and the percentage of incidents with complete audit trails. For example, after INC-4720, mean revocation time dropped to 62 seconds, meeting SLA-S-120 consistently over the next quarter."}
{"ts": "128:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given what you've laid out about cross-project impacts, let's drill into a specific late-stage decision — in ticket SEC-4421 you opted to delay a token schema change. Can you walk me through the rationale and the associated risk acceptance?"}
{"ts": "128:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. The token schema change would have broken compatibility with Orion Edge Gateway's older mTLS verifier. We were inside a 48-hour SLA window for a critical Poseidon Networking patch, so I evaluated that the immediate operational risk of service downtime outweighed the security uplift from the schema change. Documented that in the risk register RR-Q4-17 and set a 14-day remediation plan."}
{"ts": "128:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "You mentioned documenting in the risk register — how did you ensure that decision was visible to audit and compliance teams?"}
{"ts": "128:35", "speaker": "E", "text": "We tagged the register entry with AUD-24-Q4 linkage and also appended notes in the incident follow-up channel. Additionally, we set an automated reminder in the IAM runbook RB-IAM-090 to revisit the schema change, so it couldn't slip through quarterly access reviews."}
{"ts": "128:52", "speaker": "I", "text": "Alright, and when that schema change was finally deployed, what cross-system validation did you perform to verify no regressions?"}
{"ts": "129:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We ran the integration test suite that includes SSO handshake scenarios with Orion and Poseidon. Also validated JIT access provisioning flows against policy-as-code templates defined in RFC-903. The mTLS handshake logs from Orion confirmed the verifier update was in place before we switched token formats."}
{"ts": "129:18", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did you capture any lessons learned from that deferral that now influence your change management?"}
{"ts": "129:25", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, the main takeaway was to pre-coordinate schema changes with dependent teams during backlog grooming, not just at readiness review. We've added a checklist item in the CAB template to flag token structure impacts, reducing the likelihood of last-minute deferrals."}
{"ts": "129:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let’s pivot slightly — in a scenario where IAM tokens are compromised, how do you apply blast radius considerations when deciding on revocation scope?"}
{"ts": "129:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "We segment revocation by role sensitivity. High-privilege RBAC roles trigger global revocation across all active sessions; lower privilege roles may be scoped to affected tenants to avoid unnecessary downtime. This is codified in RB-IAM-075 and cross-referenced with POL-SEC-001 exceptions for emergency containment."}
{"ts": "130:08", "speaker": "I", "text": "And operationally, how does that align with our 30-minute containment SLA?"}
{"ts": "130:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "The runbook defines automated revocation actions for high-privilege tokens to execute in under five minutes via the IAM controller API. For scoped revocations we allow up to 20 minutes for tenant identification, leaving margin before the SLA breach."}
{"ts": "130:32", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let me challenge that — if detection lags, say by 15 minutes, your scoped revocation leaves little buffer. How do you mitigate?"}
{"ts": "130:40", "speaker": "E", "text": "We've recently integrated anomaly scoring from Poseidon's traffic analytics into the IAM alerting pipeline to cut detection lag. Also, during lag scenarios, we err on the side of broader revocation to ensure SLA compliance, even if it impacts usability temporarily."}
{"ts": "130:58", "speaker": "I", "text": "That ties back to the trade-off between least privilege and availability. How do you communicate such decisions to stakeholders under pressure?"}
{"ts": "131:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use the incident bridge to brief product owners and security leads, referencing the SLA clauses and current threat intel. All communications are logged in the incident record for post-mortem, making the rationale auditable and feeding into continuous improvement cycles."}
{"ts": "132:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the SLA conflicts between IAM and dependent services—can we drill into how you actually structure the remediation queue when two SLAs pull in opposite directions?"}
{"ts": "132:08", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. We maintain a remediation matrix in the OpsKanban board that references SLA-443 for IAM and SLA-527 for the Orion Edge Gateway. When both breach windows overlap, I apply the prioritisation rule from RUN-IAM-220: security-impact-first. That means if the IAM breach could result in token misuse or RBAC policy violation per POL-SEC-001, it jumps ahead of an Orion throughput breach."}
{"ts": "132:23", "speaker": "I", "text": "That sounds rigid—what if the Orion issue is indirectly causing the IAM breach?"}
{"ts": "132:31", "speaker": "E", "text": "Then we link the tickets. For example, in INC-2024-0715, a misconfigured mTLS handshake in Orion blocked SSO callbacks, which in turn caused IAM session timeouts. In that case, we escalated a joint war room with both teams, effectively treating it as a single incident with dual owners."}
{"ts": "132:46", "speaker": "I", "text": "Walk me through how you documented that scenario for audit purposes."}
{"ts": "132:53", "speaker": "E", "text": "We used the incident template from RUN-IAM-101. The evidence included Orion's handshake logs, IAM's auth_failure metrics from PromDash, and a timeline of Slack comms. All were attached to the ticket and cross-referenced in the quarterly audit package as part of AUD-24-Q3."}
{"ts": "133:08", "speaker": "I", "text": "Okay, let's pivot to a risk trade-off. When you accept a temporary POL-SEC-001 exception for a hotfix, how do you bound that risk?"}
{"ts": "133:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "We apply a short-lived policy override in the policy-as-code repo, tagged with EXC-ID and expiry metadata. For instance, EXC-2024-009 allowed elevated DB read for 2 hours to fix replication lag. The override is enforced by the pipeline to auto-revoke on expiry, and we post-mortem the exception in the Change Advisory Board."}
{"ts": "133:31", "speaker": "I", "text": "And have you ever had an override fail to revoke?"}
{"ts": "133:38", "speaker": "E", "text": "Once, in EXC-2023-112, due to a misconfigured Git webhook, the revocation job didn’t trigger. The detection came from our daily privilege diff report. That led to an update in RUN-IAM-305 to include a secondary cron-based revocation check."}
{"ts": "133:53", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. What metrics do you track post-incident to ensure such control gaps are closed?"}
{"ts": "134:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "Key metrics include mean time to revoke (MTTRv), override expiry adherence rate, and audit finding recurrence. After EXC-2023-112, MTTRv dropped from 45 min to under 10 min within two sprints."}
{"ts": "134:13", "speaker": "I", "text": "Last one—how do lessons from IAM incidents feed into other projects like Poseidon Networking?"}
{"ts": "134:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a cross-project security guild. After the token replay incident INC-2024-0543, we recommended Poseidon adopt our session-bound token pattern. Their team updated NET-POL-019 to enforce source-IP pinning, reducing the blast radius if a token leaks."}
{"ts": "134:35", "speaker": "I", "text": "So you see tangible policy changes cross-pollinating."}
{"ts": "134:39", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. The IAM hardening isn’t isolated—it propagates. That’s why in the Operate phase of Aegis IAM, we embed ourselves in upstream and downstream design reviews to spot such dependencies early."}
{"ts": "136:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let’s pivot to the Poseidon Networking angle again — if you imagine a VLAN tagging misconfig on their side, how could that realistically bypass the RBAC enforcement in Aegis IAM?"}
{"ts": "136:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. If Poseidon mis-tags a VLAN, a subnet intended for internal service accounts could end up routed into a less restricted zone. That means the network layer might not trigger the IP-based conditional policies we have in policy-as-code. Without that, Aegis IAM would issue tokens to endpoints that shouldn't even be in the trust boundary."}
{"ts": "136:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "And your mitigation? Please be specific about cross-team coordination."}
{"ts": "137:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "We run a weekly config diff with Poseidon’s exported YAML against our expected network ACL manifest. If any ingress IP ranges change without a linked RFC in our change board — say RFC-903-Delta — we block new service principal issuances until it's cleared. It’s in Runbook RB-IAM-122, section 4.3."}
{"ts": "137:35", "speaker": "I", "text": "Alright. Now, mTLS enforcement: what’s the handshake between Orion Edge Gateway and Aegis IAM to ensure both layers validate the client?"}
{"ts": "137:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "We agreed on shared trust anchors. Orion validates the cert against the enterprise PKI, then passes the client_dn in a signed header to Aegis IAM. IAM then re-verifies the cert serial against our CRL before mapping to the RBAC role. This dual check was formalized in RFC-OG-AEG-202."}
{"ts": "138:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "If IAM tokens get compromised, what blast radius containment steps do you immediately apply?"}
{"ts": "138:35", "speaker": "E", "text": "We first revoke the signing key in our HSM, invalidating all active tokens — that's RB-IAM-075 emergency mode. Then we push a deny-all policy to our API gateway via the automation pipeline. Simultaneously, we notify dependent services so they can enforce local fail-closed behaviours."}
{"ts": "139:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "You’ve mentioned RB-IAM-075 twice now — in a high-pressure situation, how do you ensure auditability while executing it at speed?"}
{"ts": "139:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "The runbook mandates screen recording and CLI session logging to our secure syslog collector. Also, every command is run via our wrapper script, which auto-tags it with the incident ticket ID, e.g., INC-24-4412, so the audit trail is complete."}
{"ts": "139:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let’s talk about a trade-off: strict least privilege vs operational agility. Give me a concrete case from Aegis IAM."}
{"ts": "140:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "In Q1 we had a production outage in the billing microservice. The strict RBAC policy meant only two engineers could access the DB. We granted a 2‑hour JIT admin role to three more staff under POL-SEC-001 exception clause 2.2, logged under RFC-EXC-019. That restored service 90 minutes faster but temporarily expanded our attack surface."}
{"ts": "140:35", "speaker": "I", "text": "So you formally documented that exception?"}
{"ts": "140:45", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, and we fed it into AUD-24-Q2 review. The lesson learned was to pre-authorize a larger on-call pool for critical systems, with time-boxed credentials auto-generated via our policy-as-code pipeline."}
{"ts": "141:10", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, given a conflict between IAM SLA of 99.99% and a dependent service SLA of 99.9%, how do you prioritise remediation when both are impacted?"}
{"ts": "141:30", "speaker": "E", "text": "We prioritise the one with higher business criticality and contract penalties. In our last incident, even though Aegis IAM’s SLA was tighter, the dependent ERP service had a higher penalty clause. We stabilised ERP first, while running IAM in degraded mode, documented under INC-24-4470 with a full root cause and risk acceptance note."}
{"ts": "145:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned RFC-903 influencing your policy-as-code deployment. Could you elaborate on how that standard actually changes your RBAC enforcement in Aegis IAM?"}
{"ts": "145:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, RFC-903 formalises the hierarchical policy structures and the JSON schema we use in our Git-based policy repo. That means our RBAC enforcement engine must validate each merged policy PR against the schema, and reject any that would violate POL-SEC-001 constraints—like an overbroad wildcard in a role definition."}
{"ts": "145:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "And when onboarding a new application into SSO, how do you ensure those schema checks aren't bypassed under time pressure?"}
{"ts": "145:21", "speaker": "E", "text": "We embed the validation into our onboarding runbook RB-SSO-042. Step 7 specifically triggers a pre-merge pipeline enforcing both the schema and a delta-report showing new permissions versus baseline. Even in urgent cases, the runbook allows only a temporary scoped role with a 24h TTL, logged under ticket type IAM-TEMP."}
{"ts": "145:33", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let's talk about cross-project dependencies. Give me a concrete scenario where Poseidon Networking misconfiguration could bypass IAM controls."}
{"ts": "145:39", "speaker": "E", "text": "If Poseidon's network ACLs are set to allow unrestricted east-west traffic between service subnets, a microservice could bypass Aegis's token verification by calling internal APIs directly. We've documented this in risk register entry RR-POS-017, with a mitigation requiring Poseidon to default-deny and enforce mTLS at ingress."}
{"ts": "145:52", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how do you coordinate with the Orion Edge Gateway team on the mTLS part?"}
{"ts": "145:57", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a cross-project RFC, RFC-OEG-12, mandating mutual certificate pinning at both gateway and service mesh layers. Orion's Envoy configs are templated from a central repo, and Aegis IAM publishes its public certs there. We run joint quarterly drills—last one was DR-2024-Q1—to simulate cert rotation failures and ensure no layer drops verification."}
{"ts": "146:11", "speaker": "I", "text": "Shifting to incident response: walk me through RB-IAM-075 in the context of our SLA for emergency revocation."}
{"ts": "146:17", "speaker": "E", "text": "RB-IAM-075 prescribes a 5-minute MTTD and 10-minute MTTR for high-severity revocations. The runbook's first step is to freeze the affected principal in the LDAP backend, then propagate a revocation event to all OIDC sessions via the EventBridge. SLA breach triggers escalation to L3 IAM on-call plus the compliance officer. We validate completion by verifying no active session tokens in the audit query AQ-REV-09."}
{"ts": "146:33", "speaker": "I", "text": "What indicators do you monitor to trigger that emergency revocation?"}
{"ts": "146:38", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have SIEM rules for anomalous geolocation access, impossible travel, and privilege escalation outside approved change windows. Any match results in an automatic RB-IAM-075 invocation, with correlation ID linking the SIEM event, the LDAP change log, and the IAM audit trail for post-mortem."}
{"ts": "146:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given conflicting SLAs between IAM and a dependent service, how do you prioritise remediation when both report incidents simultaneously?"}
{"ts": "146:55", "speaker": "E", "text": "We follow the Operations Prioritisation Matrix in OP-MAT-03. If the IAM issue could cascade into multiple dependent outages, it takes precedence even if the dependent's SLA is tighter in isolation. We communicate this via the Joint Incident Bridge, and document risk acceptance if the dependent's SLA is breached."}
{"ts": "147:07", "speaker": "I", "text": "Lastly, what metrics do you track post-incident to validate improvements?"}
{"ts": "147:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "We track MTTD/MTTR against the SLA, false positive rates from SIEM triggers, and the percentage of incidents where runbook adherence was 100%. After AUD-24-Q2, we also added a 'policy drift' metric from our Git repo scans to ensure no unreviewed RBAC changes sneak in. These feed into our quarterly IAM hardening sprint backlog."}
{"ts": "146:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you referenced RFC-903 in passing. Can you elaborate exactly how it shapes your policy-as-code deployments within Aegis IAM?"}
{"ts": "146:42", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. RFC-903 mandates deterministic policy evaluation order, and we implemented that via our HashRuleSet module in the policy engine. This ensures that POL-SEC-001 constraints are always applied before any role expansions, which has prevented at least two near-misses we identified in audit log AN-24-071."}
{"ts": "146:54", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how does that integrate with enterprise SSO onboarding for, say, a new Poseidon Networking admin console?"}
{"ts": "147:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We bake the RFC-903 ordering into the onboarding runbook RB-IAM-021. When the Poseidon console is registered in the SSO, the metadata triggers an automated policy compile. That compile includes the mTLS requirement from Orion Edge Gateway's baseline, so both network layer and IAM layer protections are enforced."}
{"ts": "147:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "You’re chaining two subsystems there. Any operational pitfalls?"}
{"ts": "147:19", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, if Orion's mTLS CA rotation is delayed, the IAM onboarding job can fail. We mitigated by adding a pre-flight check against Orion’s cert status API; this was documented in change request CR-2459 and updated in RB-IAM-021 v3.2."}
{"ts": "147:33", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching to incident response: walk me through RB-IAM-075 and how it aligns with SLA obligations for emergency revocation."}
{"ts": "147:39", "speaker": "E", "text": "RB-IAM-075 sets a 15-minute window to revoke compromised creds in priority tier-1 systems. This matches SLA-Sec-01. The script calls the revoke endpoint in Aegis, purges active sessions from Redis, and signals dependent apps via Kafka. Ticket INC-8823 was a good example where we met the SLA with 4 minutes to spare."}
{"ts": "147:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "During such high-pressure incidents, how do you ensure auditability?"}
{"ts": "148:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We attach the revocation job's JSON payload and Kafka offsets to the incident ticket. Our runbook also enforces a post-mortem evidence bundle: logs from IAM, Orion, and Poseidon, all hashed with SHA-256 and stored in secure evidence repo EV-STORE."}
{"ts": "148:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let’s revisit cross-project risk—give me a scenario where Poseidon misconfiguration could bypass IAM."}
{"ts": "148:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "If Poseidon's network ACL inadvertently whitelisted a public subnet, an attacker could hit backend APIs directly, bypassing the SSO gateway. That’s why we defined DEP-SEC-017, which runs a weekly ACL diff scan and cross-checks against IAM’s service registry."}
{"ts": "148:34", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, a trade-off: give me a concrete example where you chose user productivity over strict least privilege."}
{"ts": "148:39", "speaker": "E", "text": "During a critical Orion patch window, we granted JIT admin to the entire netops group for 2 hours, bypassing POL-SEC-001’s 1-hour cap. This was logged as exception EXC-2024-14 with explicit risk acceptance, justified by the risk of extended downtime."}
{"ts": "148:53", "speaker": "I", "text": "And you closed that loop?"}
{"ts": "148:56", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, the exception triggered an AUD-24-Q3 follow-up. Findings showed no misuse, but we adjusted RB-IAM-032 to allow conditional 2-hour JIT for patch events, reducing the need for ad hoc exceptions."}
{"ts": "148:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the SLA matrix between IAM and Poseidon Networking. Can you walk me through how you validated those alignment points during the last quarterly review?"}
{"ts": "148:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in the Q3 review I cross-referenced SLA-NET-045 from Poseidon with IAM-SLA-002. I used our internal SLA comparator script, which checks latency and uptime thresholds in both agreements. Where Poseidon's failover window exceeded our IAM token refresh period, I proposed a buffer adjustment documented in RFC-IAM-217."}
{"ts": "148:23", "speaker": "I", "text": "And did you get buy-in from their team on that change?"}
{"ts": "148:27", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, after two joint tabletop exercises they agreed. We simulated a 3-minute network partition to see if token expiry caused user lockout. The runbook RB-NET-112 was updated to trigger pre-emptive token extensions if Poseidon's heartbeat drops below threshold."}
{"ts": "148:39", "speaker": "I", "text": "In practice, how do you ensure this doesn't open a security gap?"}
{"ts": "148:43", "speaker": "E", "text": "We bound the extensions to a max of twice the normal TTL and log them with the security event type EVT-IAM-EXT. Audit logs show the user, the extension trigger, and the Poseidon alert correlation ID. We've tested that mTLS on Orion Edge still validates each session during the extended window."}
{"ts": "148:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of Orion Edge, any conflicts when enforcing mTLS at both layers?"}
{"ts": "149:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "Only once, during incident INC-EDGE-773. Orion's mTLS handshake timeout was shorter than the IAM's SSO redirection delay under load. We resolved it by aligning the handshake timeout with the SSO timeout plus a 1.5s buffer per RFC-903 section 4.2."}
{"ts": "149:12", "speaker": "I", "text": "Was that change tracked in your configuration repository?"}
{"ts": "149:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "Absolutely, change request CR-IAM-982 covers it. We linked it to the Orion config repo via submodule, so both teams see the diff. The rollback procedure is in RB-EDGE-IAM-04."}
{"ts": "149:27", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking forward, what risk scenarios are still open between these systems?"}
{"ts": "149:31", "speaker": "E", "text": "The main one is stale session risk if Poseidon's routing tables misdirect IAM-bound traffic. We're considering a mutual health check API that would allow IAM to revoke tokens proactively if routing anomalies are detected."}
{"ts": "149:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "How would you balance that with user productivity?"}
{"ts": "149:46", "speaker": "E", "text": "We'd implement a grace period—short enough to cap exposure but long enough for users to finish in-flight transactions, roughly 90 seconds. This would be configurable per application, with exceptions logged under POL-SEC-001 override codes."}
{"ts": "149:57", "speaker": "I", "text": "And finally, how will you measure if these mitigations actually work?"}
{"ts": "150:01", "speaker": "E", "text": "We'll track KPIs like mean time to revoke after anomaly detection, number of false-positive revocations, and cross-reference with AUD-24-Q4 findings. Also, post-incident reports will be fed into the Aegis IAM improvement backlog with sprint tags for prioritization."}
{"ts": "150:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Okay, let's pivot slightly—given the SLA conflicts you've described, how do you concretely prioritise remediation when an IAM breach overlaps with a Poseidon Networking outage?"}
{"ts": "150:13", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a decision matrix in RUN-SLA-021 that cross‑references service criticality against impact severity. In that matrix, IAM token compromise is classed as Critical‑Security, which supersedes any single-network outage unless the outage prevents containment. So in such an overlap, containment of compromised tokens takes precedence, and we coordinate with Poseidon to restore minimal network routes for revocation APIs."}
{"ts": "150:26", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how do you evidence that choice for audit purposes?"}
{"ts": "150:31", "speaker": "E", "text": "We attach the filled decision matrix sheet to the incident ticket—e.g., INC‑IAM‑4432—and include timestamps from the revocation API calls in the audit log. This way, during the quarterly AUD‑24 review, it's clear why network remediation was delayed and that it was in line with policy POL‑SEC‑001 exceptions."}
{"ts": "150:46", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned using RFC‑903 for policy‑as‑code. How would that help if Orion Edge Gateway had to enforce mTLS during such an incident?"}
{"ts": "150:54", "speaker": "E", "text": "RFC‑903 guides how policies are declaratively defined and versioned. If Orion requires mTLS enforcement, we can push an updated mTLS policy to both IAM and Edge Gateway repos simultaneously. Because the policy artifacts are signed and stored in Git‑SecOps, both services verify integrity before applying, reducing drift even amid an incident."}
{"ts": "151:09", "speaker": "I", "text": "Do you see any operational risk in pushing simultaneous policy updates across layers?"}
{"ts": "151:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, the blast radius can expand if a malformed policy is applied at multiple choke points. That's why RUN‑POL‑SAFE‑005 prescribes a staggered rollout—Edge Gateway first in a canary mode, then IAM after validation of the handshake logs. We also keep a rollback manifest ready."}
{"ts": "151:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let's talk continuous improvement—you've tied incident logs to changes; what KPIs do you track post‑incident?"}
{"ts": "151:34", "speaker": "E", "text": "We track mean time to revoke (MTTRv), policy deployment lead time, and percentage of revocations that met the SLA threshold of 5 minutes. After INC‑IAM‑4432, MTTRv improved from 7m12s to 4m58s in the following quarter."}
{"ts": "151:47", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how does that feed back into hardening the IAM platform?"}
{"ts": "151:52", "speaker": "E", "text": "We updated RB‑IAM‑075 to pre‑stage revocation lists in the cache layer, reducing dependency on slower DB queries. That change was directly informed by the lag observed in the incident logs."}
{"ts": "152:04", "speaker": "I", "text": "Now, considering user productivity, did that pre‑staging introduce any false positives or access denials?"}
{"ts": "152:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "Initially yes—we had two false denials when the cache wasn't in sync after a planned maintenance. We added a sync heartbeat and a manual override documented in RUN‑IAM‑OVR‑002. It's a trade‑off: slightly more complexity, but much faster revocation under duress."}
{"ts": "152:23", "speaker": "I", "text": "That's a clear trade‑off—security speed versus operational simplicity. Do you see this as a permanent design?"}
{"ts": "152:29", "speaker": "E", "text": "Given the SLA and regulatory landscape, yes. We've accepted the operational overhead as an ongoing cost. The decision is documented in RISK‑REG‑DEC‑2024‑07 with links to the runbook and RFC‑903 alignment notes."}
{"ts": "152:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the blast radius considerations for token compromise. Could you elaborate on how that interacts with the Poseidon Networking microsegmentation policies?"}
{"ts": "152:11", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, so with Poseidon's microsegmentation, any token misuse is confined to a segment’s defined egress policies. In practice, per RUN-IAM-041 we push dynamic ACL updates when an IAM token is flagged, and Poseidon’s API gateway enforces those within roughly 45 seconds."}
{"ts": "152:19", "speaker": "I", "text": "And does that timing meet our SLA for containment? I recall SLA-SEC-04 sets a 60 second benchmark."}
{"ts": "152:24", "speaker": "E", "text": "Correct, we’re within SLA. We validated that during the simulated breach drill in ticket INC-2024-1187, where the measured containment was 47 seconds from detection to blocked egress."}
{"ts": "152:33", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do you ensure that these drills reflect realistic load and dependency conditions?"}
{"ts": "152:38", "speaker": "E", "text": "We schedule them during peak transaction periods for Aegis IAM, aligning with Orion Edge Gateway’s busiest sync windows. That way, we can see how containment behaves when mTLS handshakes are at their maximum volume."}
{"ts": "152:47", "speaker": "I", "text": "Right, and if Orion’s mTLS enforcement were down, would containment still succeed?"}
{"ts": "152:52", "speaker": "E", "text": "It would, but the path changes. Without mTLS, Poseidon’s layer would become the primary choke point, so we’d trigger RB-IAM-075’s fallback, which includes temporary IP whitelisting adjustments and forced re-auth for active sessions."}
{"ts": "153:01", "speaker": "I", "text": "Fallbacks can be risky. How do you communicate that risk to stakeholders during an incident?"}
{"ts": "153:06", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use the incident bridge and a predefined risk classification matrix from POL-SEC-001 Appendix D. It’s linked in our runbook so the on-duty lead can brief stakeholders with impact scores and mitigation timelines."}
{"ts": "153:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Can you give me a specific example where this process changed after an audit?"}
{"ts": "153:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "After AUD-24-Q2, we added a live dashboard for active revocations. The audit found that waiting for hourly summaries delayed management’s understanding of scope, so now metrics like 'tokens revoked in last 5 min' are visible instantly."}
{"ts": "153:29", "speaker": "I", "text": "And those metrics feed into continuous improvement loops?"}
{"ts": "153:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. We log them to our SIEM with incident IDs, and during post-mortems they’re matched against RFC-903 compliance criteria to spot systemic policy lag."}
{"ts": "153:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given all that, what’s your biggest open risk right now in the Aegis IAM operate phase?"}
{"ts": "153:47", "speaker": "E", "text": "The main one is balancing just-in-time provisioning speed with thorough entitlement validation. We’re piloting a cache pre-warm mechanism per RFC-903 section 7, but until it’s proven, there’s a slight window where a user might receive stale role data. We’ve documented this in RSK-2024-09 with mitigations like temporary read-only scope issuance."}
{"ts": "153:38", "speaker": "I", "text": "Before we wrap, I want to probe your thoughts on the continuous improvement loop. How exactly do you map audit findings directly to the policy-as-code repos in Aegis IAM?"}
{"ts": "153:46", "speaker": "E", "text": "We maintain a documented mapping in the IAM Confluence space—each AUD finding gets linked to a specific module in the policy repo. For example, AUD-24-Q2-17 about stale role bindings pointed to `roleset-prod.yaml`. We add a corrective commit with a tag referencing the audit ID, so the codebase history acts as an evidence trail."}
{"ts": "153:58", "speaker": "I", "text": "So you're saying the repo history itself doubles as audit evidence?"}
{"ts": "154:01", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. And per RB-IAM-075 section 4.2, we also export those commits into the compliance archive weekly. That way, if an SLA breach is alleged, we can show the precise change date and test logs."}
{"ts": "154:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let’s bring Orion Edge Gateway into this. If during a token compromise incident, Orion’s mTLS enforcement is misaligned, how do you orchestrate the fix without breaking live sessions?"}
{"ts": "154:26", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use the staged rollout playbook from ORG-NET-042. First, we apply a temporary dual-cert acceptance mode in Orion so existing sessions remain valid. In parallel, we push updated IAM token validation rules. Only when both sides log a matching handshake in less than 200ms do we disable the legacy cert path."}
{"ts": "154:41", "speaker": "I", "text": "Do you log that coordination anywhere formal?"}
{"ts": "154:44", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in JIRA under cross-project ticket type CP-SEC. For example, CP-SEC-389 had all Orion and IAM changesets plus the Poseidon patch linked. It becomes part of the next quarterly dependency review."}
{"ts": "154:56", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching to usability: ever had a case where strict least privilege was actually rolled back due to productivity complaints?"}
{"ts": "155:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in incident INC-2024-077. We had enforced 30‑minute JIT expiry for DevOps in staging. Build pipelines began failing mid‑deploy. We extended the expiry to 90 minutes temporarily, documented the exception under EXC-SEC-021, and added MFA step‑up as compensating control."}
{"ts": "155:17", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do you decide when to revert such exceptions?"}
{"ts": "155:21", "speaker": "E", "text": "We set a review date in the exception record, usually one sprint later. Then we run targeted role usage reports. If automated tests and user feedback confirm stability, we revert to the baseline policy."}
{"ts": "155:33", "speaker": "I", "text": "And if the sprint priorities change?"}
{"ts": "155:36", "speaker": "E", "text": "Then the exception must be re‑approved by the IAM CAB per POL-SEC-001, section 5.3. That prevents silent drift. Even under production fire‑drill conditions, we keep that governance loop intact."}
{"ts": "155:49", "speaker": "I", "text": "Alright, final point—given conflicting SLAs between IAM and Poseidon Networking, how do you prioritise remediation without violating either?"}
{"ts": "155:58", "speaker": "E", "text": "We lean on the risk matrix in RUN-SEC-009. It defines that confidentiality-impacting issues in IAM take precedence over availability issues in Poseidon unless the latter has a cascading effect on authentication. We document the rationale in the joint SLA tracker, so both teams have a signed-off record."}
{"ts": "155:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the Poseidon Networking integration; could you detail a concrete failure mode where a routing misconfig could undermine Aegis IAM's token validation?"}
{"ts": "155:14", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in one incident simulation we found that a misadvertised route in Poseidon's BGP config could bypass the Layer 7 ingress filter we rely on for token introspection. Without the traffic hitting the expected ingress, the mTLS handshake defined in RFC-903-AegisExt wouldn't trigger, so the session would be treated as implicitly trusted until the TTL expired."}
{"ts": "155:39", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how would you mitigate that cross-layer exposure?"}
{"ts": "155:46", "speaker": "E", "text": "We implemented a secondary verification inside the IAM core—essentially a policy-as-code check that queries the Orion Edge Gateway's attest service. Even if Poseidon misroutes, the Gateway still requires signed claims for JIT access, which are short-lived per POL-SEC-001."}
{"ts": "156:09", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let's pivot to incident evidence. When you follow RB-IAM-075 for emergency revocation, how do you ensure full auditability in a compressed timeline?"}
{"ts": "156:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "The runbook mandates that every revocation is triggered via the 'secure-revoke' CLI wrapper, which pushes an event into our immutable AuditStream. Even under pressure, that wrapper enforces metadata capture—ticket ID, operator ID, revocation reason—so we can later align with SLA-IR-02 response time obligations."}
{"ts": "156:44", "speaker": "I", "text": "Do you ever bypass that wrapper in a critical outage?"}
{"ts": "156:51", "speaker": "E", "text": "Only under the break-glass procedure documented in RB-IAM-999. Even then, the wrapper is preloaded in the secure bastion, so it's still used, but we might circumvent certain MFA steps if the SLA breach risk is higher than the temporary auth risk."}
{"ts": "157:13", "speaker": "I", "text": "In terms of continuous improvement, what specific change came from the last AUD-24-Q2 audit?"}
{"ts": "157:21", "speaker": "E", "text": "They found our access review cadence was too quarterly for high-risk roles, so we moved to a 30-day review for any role with Orion or Poseidon admin rights. We codified that in policy.yaml and integrated it into the CI pipeline for policy-as-code."}
{"ts": "157:44", "speaker": "I", "text": "How did you validate that shortening the cadence actually reduced risk?"}
{"ts": "157:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "We tracked a KPI—mean time to revoke stale high-privilege accounts—and saw it drop from 27 days to 6 days over two review cycles. Incident tickets IAM-2241 and IAM-2264 are good examples; both were caught in the new monthly sweep."}
{"ts": "158:13", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given this tighter loop, have you seen an impact on operational overhead?"}
{"ts": "158:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, ops workload went up about 15%, but we offset that with automation—using the AegisLint tool to pre-flag noncompliant assignments so reviewers spend less time on benign cases."}
{"ts": "158:39", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, in a hypothetical where IAM tokens are compromised and Orion Edge Gateway is also degraded, how do you prioritise remediation given conflicting SLAs?"}
{"ts": "158:51", "speaker": "E", "text": "We'd follow the risk-based prioritisation in SEC-RFC-77: contain token misuse first to limit blast radius, even if it means Orion SLA breach. Evidence from the IAM-DR-03 drill showed that delaying token revocation by just 5 minutes increased lateral movement risk by 40%, outweighing the cost of degraded edge services."}
{"ts": "160:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned RB-IAM-075 in passing; can you now walk me through exactly how that runbook's sequence aligns with our 4‑hour SLA for emergency access revocation?"}
{"ts": "160:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. RB-IAM-075 defines a 7‑step escalation chain — starting with automated token invalidation via the Aegis revoke API, then manual verification in the audit dashboard, followed by notifying the service owners. Steps 1 to 3 are designed to complete within 45 minutes, leaving buffer for anomaly checks and compliance sign‑off. This pacing keeps us well under the 4‑hour SLA margin."}
{"ts": "160:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how do you ensure those steps aren't skipped under pressure?"}
{"ts": "160:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "We embed mandatory checkpoints in the orchestration tool. If, for example, the audit dashboard verification isn't logged, the workflow won't progress to owner notification. We've also tied these checkpoints to SLA metrics in our monitoring, so any missed step triggers an SLA breach alert."}
{"ts": "160:31", "speaker": "I", "text": "Alright, switching to cross‑project dependencies: can you give me a concrete case where Poseidon Networking misconfig could invalidate Aegis IAM's RBAC controls?"}
{"ts": "160:36", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes — in Ticket SEC‑PN‑442 last quarter, a mis‑applied routing policy bypassed the internal API Gateway, allowing direct traffic to a microservice that trusts only source IP ranges. Because the IAM enforcement point sits at the gateway, this path completely sidestepped RBAC checks until Poseidon ACLs were corrected."}
{"ts": "160:48", "speaker": "I", "text": "How did you mitigate the blast radius in that case?"}
{"ts": "160:53", "speaker": "E", "text": "We used Orion Edge Gateway's mTLS enforcement as a backstop — even though routes were wrong, the mTLS cert validation still blocked most unauthenticated calls. We also pushed an emergency policy‑as‑code update that added service‑level token verification, documented in RFC‑IAM‑217."}
{"ts": "161:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of policy‑as‑code, how does RFC‑903 influence your deployment cadence?"}
{"ts": "161:11", "speaker": "E", "text": "RFC‑903 mandates pre‑prod conformance tests for all new policies. That means our deployment cadence is gated by the test cycle — usually 48 hours for critical policies. In practice, we batch low‑priority changes to avoid constant retesting, but hotfixes for compliance issues can still be pushed within the day."}
{"ts": "161:22", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let’s touch on usability trade‑offs. Describe a time you let productivity outweigh strict least privilege."}
{"ts": "161:28", "speaker": "E", "text": "During DEV‑OPS‑INC‑301, our build pipeline was stalled due to overly granular RBAC roles missing new API scopes. Implementing fixes would have taken 6 hours; instead, we issued a 2‑hour temporary role with elevated scopes to unblock builds, logged the deviation against POL‑SEC‑001, and scheduled a post‑incident review to tighten scopes again."}
{"ts": "161:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "What risks did you accept in that decision?"}
{"ts": "161:47", "speaker": "E", "text": "Primarily the risk of over‑privileged access in the CI/CD environment. We mitigated by limiting the role to specific service accounts and enabling verbose logging, so forensic evidence would be available if misuse occurred."}
{"ts": "161:56", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, how do you feed vulnerability management outcomes back into IAM hardening?"}
{"ts": "162:01", "speaker": "E", "text": "We map each CVE from the VulnTrack system to impacted IAM modules. For example, after CVE‑IAM‑2024‑019, we updated token signature algorithms and added regression tests in the policy pipeline. These changes are logged in AUD‑24‑Q3 for audit traceability and to inform the next quarterly review."}
{"ts": "161:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned RFC-903 when we talked about policy-as-code. Can you now walk me through how that RFC shaped the automated policy testing in Aegis IAM?"}
{"ts": "161:41", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. RFC-903 essentially formalized our approach to declarative RBAC definitions and mandated automated validation before deployment. In our CI pipeline, we have a stage that runs the `poltest` tool against simulated directory data to ensure that new role bindings don't violate POL-SEC-001. It was inspired by section 4.2 of the RFC, which stresses pre-merge enforcement."}
{"ts": "161:52", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how do you integrate those tests with the enterprise SSO onboarding process for a new application?"}
{"ts": "161:56", "speaker": "E", "text": "We tie it into the onboarding runbook RB-SSO-019. When a new app is registered in our SSO metadata store, a skeleton policy is generated. That policy goes through the same RFC-903 testing gates. Only after passing all automated checks do we allow the app's service account to be provisioned in the IdP."}
{"ts": "162:08", "speaker": "I", "text": "Okay, shifting to incidents. In RB-IAM-075, what's the first thing you do when you get an emergency revocation trigger?"}
{"ts": "162:13", "speaker": "E", "text": "Step one is to verify the trigger source—whether it's an automated anomaly in our UEBA system or a manual SOC request. Once verified, RB-IAM-075 instructs us to revoke all active sessions tied to the subject identity within 90 seconds. That ensures we meet the 2-minute revocation SLA in SLA-SEC-02."}
{"ts": "162:27", "speaker": "I", "text": "And during that high-pressure period, how do you maintain auditability?"}
{"ts": "162:31", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use the Evidence Collection Module to record each revocation API call, correlated with the incident ticket ID—say INC-24-1987. All actions are time-stamped and written to the immutable audit log. Even if we act in parallel across regions, the EVID chain remains consistent for post-incident review."}
{"ts": "162:44", "speaker": "I", "text": "Good. Now, imagine Poseidon Networking has a misconfigured firewall allowing bypass of IAM's token introspection endpoint. How would you detect and respond?"}
{"ts": "162:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "That misconfiguration would likely show up as anomalous successful access logs without corresponding token checks in our IdP. We'd detect it via our cross-project telemetry dashboard that fuses Poseidon's netflow data with IAM's OIDC logs. Response would involve raising a joint incident under the XPR-SEC protocol, revoking affected tokens, and pushing a hotfix to Poseidon's config."}
{"ts": "163:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "When coordinating with the Orion Edge Gateway team on mTLS, what’s your approach to ensuring enforcement at both gateway and IAM layers?"}
{"ts": "163:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "We agree on a shared certificate authority and exchange the CA fingerprints during a controlled change window per CHG-OR-112. Orion enforces mTLS on ingress, while IAM validates the client cert DN against its policy store before issuing tokens. That way, even if one layer is misconfigured, the other provides a backstop."}
{"ts": "163:23", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let’s talk trade-offs. Can you recall a case where you had to relax least privilege to maintain productivity?"}
{"ts": "163:27", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, during the Q1 payroll outage. Finance needed urgent write access to a locked ledger service. POL-SEC-001 would normally block it, but we issued a time-bound, JIT access exception for 4 hours, documented in EXC-SEC-014, and monitored all actions. This minimized downtime while keeping the scope controlled."}
{"ts": "163:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, after AUD-24-Q2's findings, what concrete change did you implement in the access review cadence?"}
{"ts": "163:47", "speaker": "E", "text": "We shifted from semi-annual to quarterly access reviews for high-privilege roles. The audit noted stale permissions in two service accounts. By increasing cadence and integrating review tasks into our IAM dashboard, we cut stale privilege occurrences by 60% in two cycles."}
{"ts": "162:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let's move into the concrete steps you take when onboarding a new application into the Aegis IAM SSO ecosystem—walk me through that end-to-end."}
{"ts": "162:11", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure, so first we validate that the app owner has submitted the IAM-ONB-REQ template, which includes the RBAC mapping to roles defined under POL-SEC-001. Then we create a policy-as-code branch, usually in the 'iam-policies' repo, following RFC-903 naming conventions."}
{"ts": "162:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "After that, we integrate the SAML or OIDC metadata into the SSO broker, run a pre-prod federation test, and execute the onboarding checklist from RB-IAM-042 before promoting to production."}
{"ts": "162:26", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how do you ensure that no excessive privileges slip through during that onboarding?"}
{"ts": "162:30", "speaker": "E", "text": "We leverage automated scans against the role definitions—any deviation from the least-privilege baseline triggers a block in the CI pipeline. Additionally, a manual peer review is required, and the sign-off is logged in ticket IAM-ONB-2315."}
{"ts": "162:38", "speaker": "I", "text": "Regarding cross-project impacts, give me a concrete multi-hop risk that could emerge from Poseidon Networking into Aegis IAM."}
{"ts": "162:44", "speaker": "E", "text": "If Poseidon's ingress ACLs are misconfigured to allow unrestricted internal traffic, it could permit lateral movement that bypasses IAM's mTLS enforcement. For example, a compromised service in that network segment could impersonate another service via unverified calls, thus bypassing our token introspection layer."}
{"ts": "162:55", "speaker": "E", "text": "We mitigate this by ensuring Poseidon enforces CIDR whitelists that align with the service registry, and by coordinating with their team for periodic joint pen-tests."}
{"ts": "163:02", "speaker": "I", "text": "In such a scenario, what runbook steps would you trigger under RB-IAM-075?"}
{"ts": "163:07", "speaker": "E", "text": "Step one is to initiate emergency revocation for any tokens issued to compromised endpoints. Step two is isolating the affected service accounts via the 'suspend-entity' API. All actions are timestamped and cross-referenced with the SOC's incident log for auditability."}
{"ts": "163:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "You mentioned auditability—during a high-pressure incident, how do you maintain that without slowing response time?"}
{"ts": "163:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "We script most of the containment actions and have them push to an immutable audit stream. So while the engineering team executes commands, the logging subsystem captures full context—command, parameters, operator ID—in real time, meeting our SLA of audit log availability within 5 minutes."}
{"ts": "163:30", "speaker": "I", "text": "Late in the incident, have you ever had to make a trade-off that risked policy compliance for the sake of uptime?"}
{"ts": "163:35", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in Incident IAM-PRD-774 last quarter, we granted temporary elevated rights to the DB sync service to restore a critical dependency, knowingly breaching POL-SEC-001. This was justified under the emergency exception clause, documented in the waiver form and approved by the CISO within 20 minutes."}
{"ts": "163:45", "speaker": "E", "text": "We mitigated the risk by setting a 30-minute expiry on those rights and having a second engineer validate revocation—lessening the blast radius."}
{"ts": "163:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "And those lessons fed back into platform hardening?"}
{"ts": "164:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "Correct—post-incident review led to implementing automated expiry for all emergency roles, and updating RB-IAM-075 to include a checklist for CISO sign-off tracking, closing the feedback loop for continuous improvement."}
{"ts": "164:30", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the emergency revocation process. Can you detail how RB-IAM-075 ensures compliance with our 15-minute SLA for access termination after a security trigger?"}
{"ts": "164:36", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, RB-IAM-075 defines a sequence starting with automated detection from the SIEM feed, mapping to the session table in Aegis IAM. The runbook mandates a revoke_session API call within 3 minutes, followed by a verification sweep. This is audited against LOG-IAM-SEC streams to ensure we meet the 15-minute SLA—usually, we close in under 8 minutes."}
{"ts": "164:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "And if the automated revoke fails, what's the fallback?"}
{"ts": "164:54", "speaker": "E", "text": "Fallback is manual session purge via the admin console, authenticated with the 'break-glass' JIT role defined in POL-SEC-001 Appendix B. We have a two-person rule there, which sometimes bumps close-out to 12 minutes but keeps us compliant."}
{"ts": "165:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching gears, suppose Poseidon Networking misconfigures a subnet ACL, allowing bypass of our mTLS enforcement. How do you detect that from IAM's perspective?"}
{"ts": "165:13", "speaker": "E", "text": "We correlate failed mTLS handshakes from Orion Edge Gateway logs with IAM token usage logs. If we see tokens being accepted from IP ranges that should be blocked per Poseidon's ACL config, that's a red flag. That insight relies on cross-project log normalization defined in RFC-903 Section 4."}
{"ts": "165:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "So the RFC isn't just about policy-as-code for RBAC—it also covers telemetry normalization?"}
{"ts": "165:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. RFC-903 mandates JSON schema alignment across Aegis IAM, Orion, and Poseidon so we can write cross-system compliance queries. That multi-hop detection is only possible because of that schema parity."}
{"ts": "165:46", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let's talk trade-offs. In the last quarter, did you ever relax least privilege to maintain uptime?"}
{"ts": "165:52", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, during Incident INC-24-118, a critical payroll app integration failed due to overly strict RBAC on a service account. We temporarily added 'finance-app-read' to the account without full peer review under the urgent fix clause in POL-SEC-001 Section 7. Risk acceptance was documented in RISK-LOG-77 and rolled back in 36 hours."}
{"ts": "166:08", "speaker": "I", "text": "Was that rollback verified?"}
{"ts": "166:11", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, change ticket CHG-24-442 includes the rollback evidence—API diff output and audit log screenshots. Internal audit reviewed it during AUD-24-Q3, and it passed without findings."}
{"ts": "166:22", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do you balance that kind of urgent exception with ongoing improvement cycles?"}
{"ts": "166:28", "speaker": "E", "text": "We feed each exception into the post-incident review template, mapping root cause to a control gap. In the payroll case, we updated the RBAC policy-as-code repo to include a 'critical integration' exception workflow, reducing the chance of repeating the same urgent bypass."}
{"ts": "166:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "And your KPIs post-incident—how do you know the fix sticks?"}
{"ts": "166:47", "speaker": "E", "text": "We track 'unauthorized role grant count' and 'exception lifespan' metrics. A drop in both over two quarters signals improvement. Those are visualized in the IAM Ops dashboard and reviewed every CAB meeting."}
{"ts": "165:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "You mentioned earlier the SLA tension between IAM and dependent services—can you walk me through a concrete example where that impacted the Aegis IAM operate phase?"}
{"ts": "165:13", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, one case was incident ticket INC-2024-193, where Poseidon Networking's API latency exceeded our 200ms threshold. According to SLA-SYS-002, we had a 15‑minute remediation window, but their SLA allowed 30. We had to implement a temporary read‑only token policy per RB‑IAM‑075 to bridge that gap."}
{"ts": "165:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how did you communicate that decision across teams?"}
{"ts": "165:34", "speaker": "E", "text": "We followed the cross‑project escalation matrix defined in RFC‑903 appendix C. I posted a priority‑1 update in the shared incident channel and linked the runbook RB‑XPR‑014 for emergency inter‑service throttling, so Orion Edge Gateway and Poseidon both could apply the same token constraints."}
{"ts": "165:49", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there any audit implications from that workaround?"}
{"ts": "165:55", "speaker": "E", "text": "Absolutely. AUD‑24‑Q2 had flagged inconsistent token scopes in a similar past event. This time we ensured all scope changes were logged in the immutable audit stream, including operator IDs and JIT grant timestamps, to satisfy POL‑SEC‑001 section 4.2."}
{"ts": "166:09", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking back, would you have accepted any higher risk to maintain usability?"}
{"ts": "166:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "In that scenario, no. The blast radius analysis from SEC‑ANL‑17 suggested a wider impact if compromised tokens were left with write privileges. Even though some user processes slowed down, the containment outweighed the productivity hit."}
{"ts": "166:29", "speaker": "I", "text": "How did this feed into continuous improvement?"}
{"ts": "166:34", "speaker": "E", "text": "We updated RB‑IAM‑075 to include a pre‑approved throttle policy for cross‑SLA events, and we added a metric—Avg. Token Scope Downgrade Time—to our post‑incident dashboard to track execution speed."}
{"ts": "166:47", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did you coordinate with any audit or compliance team after the fact?"}
{"ts": "166:53", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we had a debrief with compliance under the AUD‑PR‑05 process. They confirmed that capturing the operator narrative alongside system logs met evidentiary standards for quarterly reviews."}
{"ts": "167:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there any technical debt considerations hidden in that incident?"}
{"ts": "167:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "We realised our policy‑as‑code repo didn’t have environment‑specific tokens fully parameterised. This meant a manual edit during the incident, which is risky. We opened TECH‑DEBT‑68 to refactor those templates."}
{"ts": "167:23", "speaker": "I", "text": "Final question on this: what’s your main takeaway for balancing strict least privilege and operational overhead?"}
{"ts": "167:30", "speaker": "E", "text": "Strict least privilege is our default, but we pre‑negotiate exception patterns with service owners—documented in EXC‑CAT‑IAM—to enable rapid, controlled deviations when SLAs collide, so we don't improvise under pressure."}
{"ts": "167:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "We touched on SLA conflicts earlier. Now, can you explain how you incorporate AUD-24-Q2 recommendations into your day-to-day IAM operations?"}
{"ts": "167:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. The audit noted our quarterly access reviews were slipping into the next month. We automated triggers from our SSO logs to start RB-IAM-091, the review runbook, the first Monday after quarter end. That way, even if a holiday falls, the system sends a compliance reminder."}
{"ts": "167:22", "speaker": "I", "text": "And this automation—does it integrate directly with the Aegis IAM policy engine or via an external scheduler?"}
{"ts": "167:27", "speaker": "E", "text": "It’s via an external scheduler in Novereon’s internal orchestration layer. We post a webhook event into the IAM API, which then enforces the POL-SEC-004 review policy. This keeps policy-as-code intact, as per RFC-903, while letting orchestration handle timing."}
{"ts": "167:38", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned coordinating with Poseidon Networking. Give me a concrete example of a multi-hop issue you've mitigated recently."}
{"ts": "167:45", "speaker": "E", "text": "We had a misconfigured subnet ACL in Poseidon that allowed bypass of our mTLS enforcement for a maintenance API. Because Orion Edge Gateway still enforced client certs, traffic from that subnet only reached the Aegis IAM after double termination. We detected it via anomaly in the mTLS handshake logs, per MON-IAM-042."}
{"ts": "167:58", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. Did that require emergency revocation?"}
{"ts": "168:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we used RB-IAM-075 to revoke all JIT tokens issued in the past 24h for that API scope. We tagged the incident as INC-2024-1187 and coordinated with networking to patch the ACL before restoring access."}
{"ts": "168:12", "speaker": "I", "text": "What about user impact? Was there any productivity concern raised?"}
{"ts": "168:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "Absolutely. Some dev teams lost access to staging. We had to balance strict least privilege with productivity by issuing temporary, monitored tokens under an exception to POL-SEC-001, documented in CHG-2024-4412."}
{"ts": "168:27", "speaker": "I", "text": "That’s the trade-off space I wanted to explore. How do you justify such exceptions when auditors ask?"}
{"ts": "168:32", "speaker": "E", "text": "We point to the exception process in POL-GOV-010, include full audit logs from the IAM event store, and provide a risk acceptance signed by the service owner. Also, the temporary tokens expire in 4h and are actively monitored, reducing blast radius."}
{"ts": "168:44", "speaker": "I", "text": "Do you measure post-incident improvements?"}
{"ts": "168:48", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes. KPIs include mean time to revoke (MTR) and policy drift detections. After that incident, MTR dropped from 18 to 11 minutes, per our SLA-SEC-002 reporting, and drift alerts fell by 30%."}
{"ts": "168:59", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given those results, would you alter RB-IAM-075?"}
{"ts": "169:03", "speaker": "E", "text": "We’re drafting RFC-912 to enhance RB-IAM-075 with automated scope-limiting based on affected subnet tags from Poseidon. That way, we avoid revoking more tokens than necessary, keeping security tight while reducing disruption."}
{"ts": "169:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let's pivot to continuous improvement. After the last quarterly audit AUD-24-Q3, what specific changes did you make to the access review process?"}
{"ts": "169:47", "speaker": "E", "text": "We adjusted the cadence from semi-annual to quarterly for high-privilege roles, based on finding 3.2 of AUD-24-Q3, which showed lingering orphaned accounts. We also integrated the RB-IAM-081 runbook to automate dormant account detection."}
{"ts": "169:56", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how do you verify that automation is actually working as intended?"}
{"ts": "170:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a validation script that cross-references the automation's flagged accounts with our audit log store, specifically the SECLOG-PRD index. Any mismatch triggers a ticket in JIRA queue IAM-QC."}
{"ts": "170:08", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned cross-project dependencies. How did lessons from Poseidon Networking's misconfig incident feed back into IAM hardening?"}
{"ts": "170:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "That incident, ticket NET-INC-442, exposed a route leak that bypassed our GeoIP restrictions. We updated POL-SEC-001 Section 5 to mandate mTLS at both network and IAM layers, and added a verification step in RB-IAM-075 to check Poseidon firewall rules before approving app onboarding."}
{"ts": "170:26", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did that require coordination with Orion Edge Gateway too?"}
