{"ts": "00:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Thanks for joining today. To start, could you walk me through your primary responsibilities on Atlas Mobile during this pilot phase?"}
{"ts": "03:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. As the UX lead, I’m responsible for translating product requirements into cross-platform interaction patterns. In the pilot, that means I’m deeply involved in both the initial prototyping and in defining how our feature flags control access to experimental UI elements. I also coordinate closely with engineering to align on offline sync behaviors and how they should degrade gracefully."}
{"ts": "07:02", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. How does the UX team collaborate with engineering and product for those feature flag rollouts?"}
{"ts": "10:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a bi-weekly 'flag review' meeting, where UX, product, and engineering leads look at the FF-ATL-* namespace in our config repo. We decide which flags can move from 'beta' to 'public'. UX provides design validation—screenshots, interaction videos—so engineering can ensure the rollout matches intended flows. We document these in Confluence under the Atlas Mobile Pilot space."}
{"ts": "15:08", "speaker": "I", "text": "And what unique constraints have you encountered designing for offline sync?"}
{"ts": "19:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "The biggest constraint is reconciling state when connectivity is intermittent. For example, in ticket UX-421 we had to design a conflict resolution UI that works even with partial metadata. We also had to ensure our touch targets met WCAG 2.1 AA even when the UI is in a low-data mode, because in regulated industries, accessibility can’t be compromised by network state."}
{"ts": "23:45", "speaker": "I", "text": "How have tokenized components in DS-ATLAS v2 changed your approach to maintaining consistency across platforms?"}
{"ts": "28:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "They’ve been a game changer. Instead of manually adjusting paddings per platform, we use design tokens like spacing-md or color-primary. Those are consumed by both the React Native and native SwiftUI layers. This consistency is enforced by our CI pipeline, which runs a token parity check per the DS-ATLAS v2 runbook."}
{"ts": "33:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Can you share an example where this accelerated a complex feature delivery?"}
{"ts": "37:30", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, for the 'secure document upload' feature in sprint 14, we needed a new modal component. Because the modal tokens were already defined, we could assemble it in Figma and hand off to dev in under a day. Engineering just pulled the token set, and the component compiled without cross-platform discrepancies, saving us about three days of QA adjustments."}
{"ts": "42:18", "speaker": "I", "text": "What accessibility considerations are baked into DS-ATLAS v2?"}
{"ts": "46:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "We’ve embedded semantic color contrasts, minimum font sizes, and motion-reduction variants. Tokens have meta-tags like 'a11y-high-contrast' that trigger alternate assets. The DS-ATLAS v2 runbook section 5.3 specifies ARIA role mappings for web views embedded within the app, which we validate with automated axe-core tests."}
{"ts": "52:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "Which pilot findings have had the biggest impact on your scaling strategy?"}
{"ts": "56:40", "speaker": "E", "text": "One major finding is that our offline sync model needs adaptive scheduling. Logs from the pilot show peak sync collisions during commute hours. We’re designing a heuristic that staggers sync based on user cohort behavior to reduce server load, noted in RFC-ATL-018. This ties into both UX—avoiding blocking spinners—and SRE capacity planning."}
{"ts": "56:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "What risks do you foresee in scaling, and how are you addressing them?"}
{"ts": "57:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "The main risk is that increased concurrency will expose race conditions in our sync UI. To mitigate, we’re implementing more granular state indicators, as per change request CR-UX-009, and collaborating with QA for risk-based testing under POL-QA-014. We’re also planning a staged rollout with kill-switch flags to quickly disable problematic flows without full redeploys."}
{"ts": "90:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned that the pilot revealed some unexpected behavior in the offline sync queue. Can you elaborate on how that tied into the SRE team’s observability dashboards?"}
{"ts": "90:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, so in week 7 we noticed a pattern where large media attachments caused retries to spike. SRE had just deployed the updated GrafNex dashboards for Atlas Mobile, which tapped into our sync telemetry. That visibility let us correlate user-reported lag with backend queue saturation."}
{"ts": "90:34", "speaker": "I", "text": "And did that correlation lead to any specific UX changes?"}
{"ts": "90:41", "speaker": "E", "text": "It did—our team added a progressive upload indicator and a lightweight 'retry later' prompt. This was after a joint review under runbook RB-SYNC-022, which stipulates UI feedback for any sync delay over 5 seconds. That’s actually something not everyone knows—it’s buried in the SRE-UX interface guidelines."}
{"ts": "90:59", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting, so you’re aligning with backend SLAs through UI conventions?"}
{"ts": "91:04", "speaker": "E", "text": "Correct. The SLA for sync acknowledgement is 3 seconds for text payloads and 7 for media. Our UI microcopy and animations are calibrated to those thresholds, so we’re not promising speed we can’t deliver."}
{"ts": "91:21", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching gears, in the DS-ATLAS v2 tokenized components, how are you handling accessibility tokens for high-contrast modes?"}
{"ts": "91:29", "speaker": "E", "text": "We’ve defined semantic color tokens like `color.surface.alert` that automatically map to high-contrast palettes in both iOS and Android builds. QA runs automated sweeps with our AC-Scan tooling, but we also do manual passes with screen magnifiers to catch edge cases, per POL-A11Y-009."}
{"ts": "91:48", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there any edge cases that surprised you during those manual passes?"}
{"ts": "91:54", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in dark mode plus high contrast, the token mapping for secondary buttons produced insufficient border differentiation. Ticket MOB-UX-418 documents the fix—we adjusted the token contrast ratio from 3:1 to 4.5:1 to meet WCAG AA."}
{"ts": "92:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking ahead to scaling, what’s the main tradeoff you’re anticipating with the offline model?"}
{"ts": "92:21", "speaker": "E", "text": "The main one is between local cache size and sync frequency. For 500 pilot users, a 50MB cache is fine. Scaling to 50k users, we risk storage bloat and battery drain. We’re debating adaptive sync intervals—Runbook RB-SYNC-027 outlines thresholds based on network type and battery level, but it adds complexity in QA and observability."}
{"ts": "92:45", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do you plan to mitigate that complexity?"}
{"ts": "92:49", "speaker": "E", "text": "By staging the rollout behind feature flag `sync.adaptive.v1` and instrumenting it with extra telemetry hooks. QA will run risk-based testing per POL-QA-014, focusing on edge cases like airplane mode toggles and background app refresh settings."}
{"ts": "93:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "And in terms of security, any UI changes to accommodate new auth flows?"}
{"ts": "93:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "We’re adding inline device trust indicators in the login flow. Security flagged in RFC-SEC-112 that users weren’t aware of fallback to SMS-based OTP during offline-first logins, so now the UI clearly shows when a less secure method is being used."}
{"ts": "98:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you touched on the pilot's learnings, but I'd like to go deeper into one—could you share a concrete example of a feature flag rollout that taught you something unexpected?"}
{"ts": "98:07", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, absolutely. In sprint 6, we toggled on the enhanced offline search flag for about 120 pilot users. According to our runbook RB-ATL-FF-03, we expected a gradual adoption curve, but within two hours we saw 80% engagement. That spiked the local cache load and revealed a concurrency issue in our Android sync adapter that QA later traced back to a race condition documented in ticket BUG-ATL-142."}
{"ts": "98:32", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how did that discovery influence your scaling strategy?"}
{"ts": "98:37", "speaker": "E", "text": "It made us factor in a more conservative ramp-up for flags affecting sync-heavy features. We updated our Feature Flag SOP to include a staged rollout with synthetic load tests first, following QA's risk-based testing matrix from POL-QA-014. That matrix weighs UX impact against backend stability risks."}
{"ts": "98:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of stability, how does SRE feed into those rollout decisions during this phase?"}
{"ts": "99:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "SRE has a seat in our weekly triage. They review metrics from Prometheus and the Atlas Mobile-specific Grafana dashboards. For the offline search case, SRE flagged a 15% increase in sync queue latency, which crossed the SLA threshold in SLA-ATL-MB-002. That was the trigger for us to pause the rollout."}
{"ts": "99:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given those SLA breaches, did you have to make any UI compromises?"}
{"ts": "99:25", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, minor ones. We temporarily limited search result previews to 10 items to reduce payload size. That was a tradeoff—we noted it in design decision log DDL-ATL-118 with a risk tag 'UX-Quality'. We balanced perceived performance against completeness until the sync adapter fix landed."}
{"ts": "99:45", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there any accessibility concerns in implementing that limit?"}
{"ts": "99:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "We double-checked with our accessibility QA checklist AC-QA-ATLAS-v2. The main concern was ensuring that screen reader users got an announcement that only partial results were displayed. We used the ARIA live region pattern to communicate that context, so users understood results might be incomplete."}
{"ts": "100:10", "speaker": "I", "text": "How did Security weigh in during this adjustment?"}
{"ts": "100:14", "speaker": "E", "text": "Security reviewed the change under RFC-SEC-ATL-044 to ensure that truncating results didn’t inadvertently leak cached sensitive data. They approved it after confirming that our data masking layer, implemented per SEC-GD-017, still applied uniformly."}
{"ts": "100:32", "speaker": "I", "text": "At this point in the pilot, what do you see as the largest remaining risk for scaling?"}
{"ts": "100:37", "speaker": "E", "text": "Honestly, the biggest risk is the unpredictable interaction between offline sync bursts and live feature flag changes. We’ve modeled it in our chaos test suite CT-ATL-05, but with a larger user base, variance grows. Our mitigation plan is to implement adaptive backoff in the sync scheduler, with thresholds derived from SRE’s latency histograms."}
{"ts": "100:58", "speaker": "I", "text": "And what’s the decision timeline for that mitigation?"}
{"ts": "101:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We’re aiming for a go/no-go decision by the end of sprint 10. That’s aligned with the scaling readiness review in the Pilot Exit Checklist PEC-ATL-v1. If the adaptive backoff passes both UX acceptance and SRE load criteria, it’ll be in the production build candidate."}
{"ts": "106:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the SRE collaboration; can you share how that influenced the pilot's offline sync reliability tests?"}
{"ts": "106:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, so in the pilot we ran sync stress tests based on SRE runbook RB-SYNC-07. That meant simulating 48 hours of disconnection, then measuring merge conflict resolution times. The SRE team fed those metrics back to us so we could adjust UI feedback—like progress indicators—accordingly."}
{"ts": "106:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. Did that require any changes to the DS-ATLAS v2 components themselves?"}
{"ts": "107:08", "speaker": "E", "text": "A small one: we extended the token set for 'sync-state' colors, to visually differentiate between 'queued', 'in-progress', and 'error' states. That change cascaded through our cross-platform builds, but because of the token architecture, it only took an afternoon to update."}
{"ts": "107:38", "speaker": "I", "text": "How about QA—how do they incorporate these UX changes into risk-based testing under POL-QA-014?"}
{"ts": "107:52", "speaker": "E", "text": "QA tags UX changes with risk level codes. For example, the new sync-state indicators were marked 'Low Visual/High Functional Risk'. That triggers regression tests specifically on color contrast and state persistence, as per section 4.2 of POL-QA-014."}
{"ts": "108:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "And security? Were they involved in this tweak?"}
{"ts": "108:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "They were, indirectly. Security reviewed the error state messaging to ensure no sensitive sync metadata leaked. We have a checklist in SEC-UI-GUIDE-03 that mandates redaction of server IDs in UI strings."}
{"ts": "108:58", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking at scaling—how will these sync indicators behave for, say, ten times the current pilot user base?"}
{"ts": "109:13", "speaker": "E", "text": "We ran load tests with synthetic user IDs up to 50k. The indicator rendering stayed under 16ms per frame. The main risk is backend queue delays, which could make 'in-progress' states linger and frustrate users. We're drafting UX-FAILSAFE-02 to auto-refresh every 30 seconds to mitigate perception of stalling."}
{"ts": "109:45", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did you document that mitigation in any of the pilot's retrospectives?"}
{"ts": "109:57", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in Retrospective Doc P-ATL-RETRO3, section 'Sync UX Risks'. It includes the refresh interval decision, plus a note to revisit if backend SLA SYNC-SLA-99 changes from 2s to a higher tolerance."}
{"ts": "110:22", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given the regulated industry angle, are there compliance constraints on these indicators?"}
{"ts": "110:36", "speaker": "E", "text": "Absolutely. For instance, indicators can't use only color to convey state—per REG-MOB-ACC-12, we must include iconography and text. In the pilot, we added a lock icon for secure sync, and an exclamation for errors, alongside the colors."}
{"ts": "111:02", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, what trade-offs did you face in deciding on that 30-second refresh—any downsides?"}
{"ts": "111:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "The trade-off was between network load and user reassurance. More frequent refreshes reassure users but could spike mobile data usage, breaching our own DATA-CONSERVE-05 policy. We chose 30 seconds as a balance point, validated in Ticket UXDEC-442 with data from pilot telemetry."}
{"ts": "114:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier, you mentioned that during the pilot you had to adjust the offline sync logic after a feature flag rollout. Could you elaborate on what prompted that adjustment?"}
{"ts": "114:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. The trigger was actually a spike in conflict resolution errors we saw in QA metrics the morning after we rolled out the 'QuickEdit' flag in the Atlas Mobile pilot. Our runbook RB-SYNC-07 covers conflict handling, but the new feature introduced an edge case where both the client and server could hold unsynced edits for the same record."}
{"ts": "114:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. Was that something engineering caught, or did UX get involved in the detection phase?"}
{"ts": "114:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "It was a bit of both. QA raised a ticket—QA-ATL-233—in our system after their automated offline tests failed. But UX jumped in because the visual merge prompts were confusing users in the pilot group. We quickly prototyped a clearer merge dialog in Figma and tested it in a hotfix build."}
{"ts": "114:35", "speaker": "I", "text": "So that’s a clear case where front-end design and back-end sync logic intersected. Did you also have to align with SRE for any of this?"}
{"ts": "114:40", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, SRE was concerned about the increased load on the sync queue after the hotfix. They referenced SLA-MOB-02, which sets a 500ms max for initial sync in peak hours. We co-designed a lazy-load pattern for non-critical assets, documented in RFC-ATL-56, to keep within that SLA."}
{"ts": "114:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "That RFC—did it also touch on accessibility? I’m guessing lazy-loading could affect screen reader sequences."}
{"ts": "115:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "Good catch. We included a section in the RFC to ensure lazy-loaded elements announce themselves properly. We followed ARIA live region guidelines, and our accessibility QA checklist—ACC-CHK-04—was updated to include this scenario."}
{"ts": "115:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking back, would you say that was the most complex multi-team coordination in the pilot?"}
{"ts": "115:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "It’s up there. It was a three-way between UX, backend engineering, and SRE, with QA and Accessibility as embedded reviewers. We had to balance immediate user comprehension issues, system performance constraints, and compliance with POL-QA-014’s risk-based testing requirement."}
{"ts": "115:35", "speaker": "I", "text": "Now that you’ve resolved it, what’s the residual risk as you scale to production?"}
{"ts": "115:40", "speaker": "E", "text": "The residual risk is that in a larger user base, the probability of simultaneous offline edits grows. Our mitigation is twofold: strengthen conflict detection heuristics—outlined in SYNC-ALG-v3—and enhance the UI to guide resolution faster. We’ve scheduled load tests in staging to model this."}
{"ts": "115:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "And what’s your fallback if heuristics still cause user confusion?"}
{"ts": "116:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a rollback plan in RUN-FLG-02 that allows selective disabling of QuickEdit by user cohort via the feature flag manager. That way, we can isolate problematic patterns without a full app revert."}
{"ts": "116:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Sounds like you’ve built in resilience. Any lessons that you’ll carry into future cross-platform pilots?"}
{"ts": "116:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes—map UX edge cases to backend logic early, not just at QA. The DS-ATLAS v2 components help here because their behavior is predictable across platforms, so we can foresee issues like sync conflicts sooner."}
{"ts": "116:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the runbook for offline sync incident handling. Could you give me a concrete example from the pilot where that runbook was actually invoked?"}
{"ts": "116:07", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we had Ticket MOB-SYNC-042 in week six. A batch of Android beta users had sync queues stuck after toggling a feature flag mid-session. The runbook RNBK-MOB-07 guided us: first to capture local logs with the 'diag sync' command, then to push an interim hotfix via the beta channel. It also had a checklist for UX to verify that the fallback UI state displayed the 'Sync paused' banner clearly."}
{"ts": "116:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "And did that fallback state come from DS-ATLAS v2 components or was it custom?"}
{"ts": "116:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "It was from DS-ATLAS v2, specifically the AlertBanner tokenized component with severity set to 'info'. Because it's tokenized, it automatically inherited the correct color contrast ratios we defined for WCAG AA compliance, so we didn't have to hard-code anything in the hotfix."}
{"ts": "116:49", "speaker": "I", "text": "How did Security weigh in on that incident, if at all?"}
{"ts": "116:54", "speaker": "E", "text": "They reviewed the logs for sensitive data exposure. Our policy SEC-MOB-005 requires that sync diagnostics redact user PII before transmission. The runbook had a reminder for UX to double-check that the debug overlay showing sync IDs used masked values. We coordinated with Security via the #atlas-sec Slack channel and closed the check within the SLA of 4 hours."}
{"ts": "117:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "During that process, what was QA's role in verifying the UX changes?"}
{"ts": "117:19", "speaker": "E", "text": "QA, following POL-QA-014 for risk-based testing, created a targeted suite for the 'Sync paused' banner in offline scenarios. They validated on both iOS and Android under low-bandwidth simulation. UX provided acceptance criteria in Jira story ATLAS-UX-219, specifying banner persistence through app restarts."}
{"ts": "117:39", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking ahead, how will you adapt the offline sync model for the larger user base in production?"}
{"ts": "117:44", "speaker": "E", "text": "We plan to implement a tiered sync priority queue. High-priority data like form submissions will sync first, while lower priority assets like avatars can wait. This ties into feature flags—Ops can adjust priority levels dynamically during load spikes. UX will ensure the status indicators make that logic transparent to users."}
{"ts": "118:02", "speaker": "I", "text": "That dynamic priority—does it introduce any new risks you’ve logged?"}
{"ts": "118:07", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in RFC-ATL-118 we noted a potential risk of perceived data loss if low-priority items are deferred too long. Mitigation: a 'Pending items' panel in the app, accessible offline, showing queued assets and estimated sync times."}
{"ts": "118:22", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how do you ensure that’s accessible for assistive tech?"}
{"ts": "118:27", "speaker": "E", "text": "We test it with screen readers in our device lab, following the A11Y-MOB checklist. The panel uses semantic list roles so VoiceOver and TalkBack can read item counts and statuses. We also ensure offline announcements are queued so that they fire when connectivity returns, avoiding confusion."}
{"ts": "118:45", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, given everything from the pilot, what’s your biggest takeaway for scaling UX processes?"}
{"ts": "118:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "That early integration with Ops and Security in the design phase prevents costly rework. Embedding checklists from runbooks into our Figma components was a small change, but it ensured compliance cues are visible to designers from day one. That’s a practice we’ll formalize in the production phase."}
{"ts": "122:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the pilot data influenced some of your scaling plans. Could you elaborate on one or two of those data points that were most surprising to the team?"}
{"ts": "122:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. One standout was the sync retry rate. In the pilot logs—ticket QA-ATL-442—we saw a 17% higher retry incidence in rural test cohorts than forecast. That forced us to revisit our offline queue size defaults. We also noticed via SRE's latency dashboard that the average time to first byte post-reconnect was twice our SLA-ATL-08 budget."}
{"ts": "122:45", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how did that feed back into your design decisions, specifically in the UI?"}
{"ts": "123:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We added a progress indicator with more granular states, per RFC-UX-AT-12, so users understood whether they were in 'queueing', 'syncing', or 'verifying' mode. That reduced abandonment in session recordings. The change was tucked behind a feature flag so we could A/B test without impacting the whole pilot."}
{"ts": "123:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did that require any changes to DS-ATLAS v2 components?"}
{"ts": "123:38", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we extended the token set for status colors to include two new semantic states—'pending-sync' and 'verifying-data'—so engineers didn't hardcode hex values. That aligns with our unwritten rule that tokens drive all visual states for maintainability."}
{"ts": "124:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. How did QA incorporate that into their risk-based testing, considering POL-QA-014?"}
{"ts": "124:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "They classified the new states as medium-risk UI changes because they altered user feedback loops. QA then executed targeted regression on assistive tech flows—screen readers announcing state changes—per runbook RB-QA-MOB-07."}
{"ts": "124:40", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of assistive tech, did you encounter any tooling gaps for testing offline sync scenarios?"}
{"ts": "124:53", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, most simulators we have don't emulate connectivity loss combined with VoiceOver or TalkBack enabled. For now, we use a custom script—DEV-SIM-ATL—to toggle flight mode and trigger queued sync events while recording accessibility output."}
{"ts": "125:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking ahead, what risks are you mitigating before scaling beyond the pilot?"}
{"ts": "125:32", "speaker": "E", "text": "Two big ones: server load spikes when many clients reconnect simultaneously—SRE has proposed staggered backoff based on client IDs—and ensuring our feature flag service scales horizontally. We have an open capacity test plan, CAP-TEST-ATL-03, to validate that."}
{"ts": "125:58", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do you balance introducing new UX enhancements with the 'Safety First' principle in such moments?"}
{"ts": "126:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "We gate any feature that modifies sync logic or data presentation behind dual approvals—UX and SRE—before rollout. It's codified in our deployment checklist CL-UX-DEP-05. Even minor label changes in error states go through that path if they could influence user recovery actions."}
{"ts": "126:35", "speaker": "I", "text": "That sounds rigorous. Finally, how will you adapt the offline sync model for a larger user base?"}
{"ts": "126:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "We're moving from a fixed queue size to a dynamic model that adjusts based on device storage and recent sync success rates. Combined with predictive prefetch for high-priority data, we expect to keep within SLA-ATL-08 even as we scale to 10x the pilot users."}
{"ts": "130:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned how offline sync ties into your feature flagging approach. Could you expand on how that influenced your design handoff process to engineering in this pilot?"}
{"ts": "130:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. In the pilot, we had to account for the fact that a flagged feature might be enabled while the device is offline. So in Figma we annotated the component states for both flag-on and flag-off, plus the in-between sync state, and that fed into the dev handoff via our DS-ATLAS v2 token naming. Engineering used those tokens to map conditional rendering logic right into the cross-platform UI layer."}
{"ts": "130:27", "speaker": "I", "text": "So that means your DS tokens had to carry state metadata too?"}
{"ts": "130:31", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly, we added a suffix scheme—like `btn.primary.syncPending`—which wasn't in v1. That was documented in Runbook UX-014 so QA could simulate different sync states and verify the visuals match the functional state."}
{"ts": "130:49", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. How did that play with QA's risk-based testing under POL-QA-014?"}
{"ts": "130:54", "speaker": "E", "text": "They prioritised scenarios where a state change could cause user confusion—say a transaction button enabled too early. By tying our DS tokens to functional flags, their automated tests could hook into the same source of truth, reducing false positives in regression runs."}
{"ts": "131:12", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did Security also weigh in on those flows?"}
{"ts": "131:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, especially on the offline forms. Security raised Ticket SEC-388 when they saw a draft form retaining sensitive fields after a feature flag toggle. We resolved it by adding a `purgeOnFlagChange` pattern to the component spec, so any stored data is securely wiped on state transition."}
{"ts": "131:38", "speaker": "I", "text": "And was that change reflected back into DS-ATLAS for consistency?"}
{"ts": "131:42", "speaker": "E", "text": "It was. We updated the DS guidelines to mark certain input types as 'ephemeral' with a dedicated token property. That way, when scaling, we don't have to rediscover that requirement—design, dev, and security are aligned from the start."}
{"ts": "131:58", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of scaling, what aspects of this token/state approach will be most critical when moving to production?"}
{"ts": "132:03", "speaker": "E", "text": "The critical part is the consistency in state handling across platforms. In the pilot, we caught a case where iOS and Android rendered `syncPending` differently, impacting assistive tech announcements. That was logged as QA-INV-27 and fixed by centralising the ARIA label mapping in the token definition."}
{"ts": "132:23", "speaker": "I", "text": "So multi-platform accessibility hinged on the token definitions too."}
{"ts": "132:27", "speaker": "E", "text": "Right, because in regulated environments our SLA-UX-002 requires parity in accessibility semantics. Tokens became not just visual style carriers but semantic specifiers as well."}
{"ts": "132:41", "speaker": "I", "text": "That’s a nice multi-hop link from design to compliance. Did SRE have to adjust monitoring for these states?"}
{"ts": "132:46", "speaker": "E", "text": "They did. SRE added custom telemetry events for any state transition driven by a feature flag while offline. That way, when we sync up, they can trace if a user hit an inaccessible state and feed that back into our design backlog before production rollout."}
{"ts": "132:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you touched on adapting the offline sync model; can you expand on the specific architectural adjustments you’re considering for production scale?"}
{"ts": "132:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. In the pilot, our sync queue handler was single-threaded with a max batch size of 50. For production, we're moving to a sharded queue with adaptive batch sizing based on device metrics. That change, per RFC-ATL-043, lets us respect the SLA-OS-2 offline-to-online reconciliation target of under 90 seconds even under heavy concurrency."}
{"ts": "132:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how does that tie back into the feature flag system you’ve been using?"}
{"ts": "132:36", "speaker": "E", "text": "We actually piggyback the flag state onto the sync payload. That way, when a user comes online, they not only push their data but also pull the latest flag config. It avoids stale UI states. It's a multi-hop link between the sync subsystem and the rollout controller documented in Runbook RB-FF-09."}
{"ts": "132:54", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given that tight coupling, are there risks if one subsystem lags behind the other?"}
{"ts": "133:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, latency in sync could delay flag updates, which might expose partially migrated features. To mitigate, we have a backchannel over push notifications for high-priority flags, per Incident Ticket INC-ATL-221 lessons, so critical toggles aren't hostage to full sync."}
{"ts": "133:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let’s talk scaling risks more broadly. Which findings from the pilot most influence your risk register?"}
{"ts": "133:29", "speaker": "E", "text": "Two stand out: first, data drift incidents during prolonged offline periods, which we logged under QA anomaly reports QA-ATL-57A. Second, accessibility regressions when merging token updates; DS-ATLAS v2 enforces minimum contrast ratios, but cross-platform rendering differences still caused failures on certain Android devices."}
{"ts": "133:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do you plan to address those before full rollout?"}
{"ts": "133:57", "speaker": "E", "text": "For data drift, we’re introducing conflict resolution heuristics—user-preferred timestamp precedence unless server marks a critical override. And on accessibility, we’re adding device-specific snapshot tests into the CI, as outlined in POL-QA-014 Appendix C."}
{"ts": "134:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "You mentioned CI — does Security have any hooks in that process for UI flows?"}
{"ts": "134:22", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, per SEC-HOOK-12, every merge triggers a static scan of UI strings for PII leakage and an interactive check for auth state handling. Security flagged a modal in sprint 6 where the timeout warning wasn’t screen-reader accessible; we fixed that under Change Req CR-ATL-118."}
{"ts": "134:40", "speaker": "I", "text": "Last question on scaling: what’s the biggest trade-off you’re making to hit the production timeline?"}
{"ts": "134:48", "speaker": "E", "text": "We’re deferring full WCAG 2.2 AAA compliance for low-traffic admin screens to post-launch in favour of stabilising the core sync and flag systems. The risk is minor reputational impact with a small subset of users, but according to our risk matrix RM-ATL-Q2, it’s acceptable given the benefits to launch stability."}
{"ts": "135:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "And that’s documented for stakeholders?"}
{"ts": "135:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, it’s in the Pilot Closure Report PCR-ATL-01, section 5.3, with sign-off from Product, Security, and Compliance. Transparency here is key; we’ve learned that clear trade-off documentation prevents misaligned expectations later."}
{"ts": "136:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the integration between DS-ATLAS v2 and the pilot's feature flag system—can you expand on how that combination actually plays out in your daily workflow?"}
{"ts": "136:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure, so with our tokenized components, any visual change tied to a feature flag can be propagated with almost no manual patching. For example, when we rolled out the dark-mode toggle for offline sync screens, the DS-ATLAS v2 tokens linked to color contrast ratios automatically adjusted for both Android and iOS builds once the flag was switched in Stage."}
{"ts": "136:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "And that aligns with your accessibility compliance targets, correct?"}
{"ts": "136:19", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. We have a checklist in runbook RB-UX-023 that cross-references WCAG 2.1 AA with our custom tokens. So when the flag is activated, we run automated visual diff tests to ensure no accessibility regression, even in offline cached states."}
{"ts": "136:33", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do you coordinate these changes with the QA team, especially since you have to respect POL-QA-014 risk-based testing?"}
{"ts": "136:38", "speaker": "E", "text": "We tag each flagged UI change with a risk profile in Jira—like 'UX-Med' or 'UX-High'. QA then prioritizes test cases accordingly. If the change touches offline sync flows, it gets bumped up because any desync could breach SLA-MOB-07's 15-minute sync recovery requirement."}
{"ts": "136:54", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. Has there been a case where a seemingly minor UX change had a big SRE or security implication?"}
{"ts": "136:58", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes—Ticket ATLAS-SEC-211. We adjusted the placement of the 'Resume Sync' button for better thumb reach, but that bypassed a confirmation dialog in certain edge cases. Security flagged it because it could trigger data pushes over insecure networks if the VPN hadn't reconnected. We had to hotfix with SRE guidance in 48 hours."}
{"ts": "137:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "That’s a good example of multi-team interplay. Did the design system help resolve it faster?"}
{"ts": "137:19", "speaker": "E", "text": "Absolutely. Because the dialog component was also tokenized, we could reintroduce it across all instances by updating a single token state in DS-ATLAS v2, rather than hunting down each instance manually."}
{"ts": "137:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking ahead to scaling, do you anticipate any new risks with feature flags as you expand the offline sync model?"}
{"ts": "137:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "One risk is flag proliferation—too many conditional paths could make state reconciliation brittle at scale. Our strategy is to sunset flags within two sprints post-rollout, as per RFC-FEATURE-017, and maintain a strict cap of eight active flags per platform."}
{"ts": "137:47", "speaker": "I", "text": "And for the offline sync itself, any architectural adaptations for production scale?"}
{"ts": "137:51", "speaker": "E", "text": "We’re moving from a delta-based sync algorithm to a hybrid that includes periodic full snapshots for high-risk data sets. This mitigates corruption risks observed in pilot logs (see LOG-ATL-ERR-92) where deltas failed after schema changes."}
{"ts": "138:04", "speaker": "I", "text": "Final question on this thread—how do you capture and share these learnings so that design, QA, and SRE are aligned before scaling?"}
{"ts": "138:09", "speaker": "E", "text": "We run post-flag retros every other Friday, documented in Confluence under 'Atlas Pilot Scaling'. Each retro includes UX notes, QA defect density metrics, and SRE incident summaries, so we can decide collectively on pattern adoptions or retirements."}
{"ts": "137:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned bridging the offline sync architecture with feature flag rollouts. Could you elaborate on how that impacts QA planning in the pilot?"}
{"ts": "137:44", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. In the pilot, we defined in Runbook RB-ATL-045 that any feature flagged for partial rollout must be tested under three sync states: fully online, degraded connection, and full offline. We tie this into QA's risk matrix from POL-QA-014 so they can prioritise edge cases where user data might be stale."}
{"ts": "137:58", "speaker": "I", "text": "So the UX team actually feeds those sync state definitions into the QA scenarios?"}
{"ts": "138:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, exactly. We annotate the design specs with sync state expectations. That annotation gets parsed into their test case management tool via a custom script. It's a direct link between our Figma tokens and the QA suites."}
{"ts": "138:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. And how does that tie into accessibility testing?"}
{"ts": "138:18", "speaker": "E", "text": "We require that any interactive component under DS-ATLAS v2 is verified with screen readers in all three sync states. We learned in Ticket QA-ATL-188 that some ARIA live regions didn't announce updates when data came from the offline cache, so we patched the component and updated the token definitions."}
{"ts": "138:34", "speaker": "I", "text": "That sounds like a multi-team coordination effort."}
{"ts": "138:37", "speaker": "E", "text": "Absolutely. It involved UX, mobile engineering, and the SRE who manages the sync service. We had to align on event timing so that the UX update coincided with the cache refresh event. That alignment was documented in RFC-ATL-SYNC-07."}
{"ts": "138:52", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there any performance trade-offs in synchronising those events?"}
{"ts": "138:56", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, a slight delay in UI update for the sake of consistency. We measured a 200ms lag, but decided per our Safety First principle that correctness and accessibility trumped instant feedback. We documented that as an acceptable delay in our pilot SLA-ATL-PILOT-v1."}
{"ts": "139:12", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given those insights, how are you preparing to adapt this for production scale?"}
{"ts": "139:17", "speaker": "E", "text": "We're planning to split the event bus into priority channels, so critical UI updates for compliance-related features have their own thread. That way, accessibility announcements are never blocked by lower-priority sync events."}
{"ts": "139:30", "speaker": "I", "text": "Do you foresee any risks with that approach?"}
{"ts": "139:34", "speaker": "E", "text": "Risk-wise, channel separation could lead to race conditions if not handled carefully. In our risk register RR-ATL-09, we listed potential out-of-order UI states. We're mitigating through sequence IDs embedded in the event payloads."}
{"ts": "139:48", "speaker": "I", "text": "And is that mitigation already tested in the pilot?"}
{"ts": "139:52", "speaker": "E", "text": "Partially. We have a prototype in staging with telemetry hooks. The early logs—LogSet LS-ATL-042—show no mismatched sequences so far, but we need volume testing to be confident before go-live."}
{"ts": "145:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned that scaling the offline sync model is going to require some careful thought. How are you planning to adapt it for, say, a tenfold increase in the user base?"}
{"ts": "145:40", "speaker": "E", "text": "Right, so the main shift is moving from our current peer-based delta sync to a tiered sync service. In the pilot, the client devices handle most of the merge logic locally, but at scale we’ll centralise conflict resolution in a lightweight service layer. That’s outlined in RFC-ATL-092, which also references our bandwidth SLA targets."}
{"ts": "145:49", "speaker": "I", "text": "And that central service—does that tie into any of the feature flag infrastructure you’ve built?"}
{"ts": "145:53", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, absolutely. We’re extending the AtlasFlagDaemon to include sync mode toggles. That means we can roll out the tiered sync selectively, by cohort, and monitor latency and error rates before a full cutover. The config lives in the same GitOps repo as our UI feature flags."}
{"ts": "146:01", "speaker": "I", "text": "So there’s a risk management aspect baked in there."}
{"ts": "146:04", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. We learned during the pilot from incident INC-ATL-054 that rolling a sync change globally without staged rollout led to a spike in merge conflicts. Now, with the flags, we can mitigate that. QA has a risk-based test suite per POL-QA-014 that runs in parallel as we flip those flags."}
{"ts": "146:13", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of QA, how do UX deliverables feed into their process when the sync architecture changes?"}
{"ts": "146:17", "speaker": "E", "text": "We annotate our UX flow diagrams with sync state indicators. QA uses those to generate test cases—like what happens if a modal is open when a background sync failure occurs. It’s part of the shared Confluence runbook UX-QA-Atlas, section 3.2."}
{"ts": "146:26", "speaker": "I", "text": "And when you’re incorporating security feedback—does that ever clash with UX goals in these flows?"}
{"ts": "146:30", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sometimes. For instance, SecOps wanted an extra authentication prompt before manual conflict resolution. From a UX standpoint, that’s friction, but we compromised by using biometric prompts when available. The decision is documented in SEC-DEC-2024-17, after a joint workshop with Security and Product."}
{"ts": "146:40", "speaker": "I", "text": "That’s a good example of a tradeoff. Have you had to make similar calls with accessibility in mind?"}
{"ts": "146:44", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in offline mode, some assistive tech APIs don’t surface certain alerts. We had to implement a local queue for ARIA-live updates, so when the device reconnects, screen readers get the right context. It slightly increases local storage use, but it’s worth it for compliance with our internal ACC-GUIDE-005."}
{"ts": "146:54", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking ahead, what do you see as the biggest risk in scaling Atlas Mobile post-pilot?"}
{"ts": "146:58", "speaker": "E", "text": "The biggest risk is sync latency in low-bandwidth regions impacting perceived performance. If we miss our 500ms UI response SLA, user trust drops fast. Our mitigation is to prefetch critical datasets during idle time and use feature flags to adjust prefetch aggressiveness dynamically."}
{"ts": "147:07", "speaker": "I", "text": "So that would be monitored closely in production?"}
{"ts": "147:11", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, SRE will set up synthetic transactions in those regions to simulate offline-online transitions. Any deviation from the SLA triggers a rollback via the same flag mechanism. This closes the loop between UX design, engineering, and operational response."}
{"ts": "147:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the risk register entry RX-221 for scaling offline sync — could you walk me through the decision-making process that led to the mitigation plan?"}
{"ts": "147:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. For RX-221, we ran a cross-team review with SRE and QA using the POL-QA-014 risk-based testing framework. The mitigation plan was to stage rollouts in 10% increments, with monitoring hooks embedded in the sync service, as detailed in runbook RB-ATL-06."}
{"ts": "147:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "And did that have any direct impact on how the UX team designed the feedback loops for the user during sync?"}
{"ts": "147:26", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, absolutely. We added a non-blocking toast notification with progressive status messages, tied to the same telemetry events SRE monitored. That way, if sync latency exceeded the SLA threshold of 3 seconds for critical records, the user saw clear guidance."}
{"ts": "147:34", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. How did you balance that transparency against the 'Safety First' principle we discussed earlier?"}
{"ts": "147:41", "speaker": "E", "text": "We made a tradeoff: full transparency could risk exposing internal error codes. So we created a UX layer that maps technical states to plain-language messages, reviewed with Security under SEC-RFC-082. That kept end-users informed without leaking sensitive context."}
{"ts": "147:51", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did compliance weigh in on that mapping?"}
{"ts": "147:55", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, Compliance reviewed the mappings against guideline COM-GUI-17, ensuring we met industry disclosure rules, especially for regulated clients. Their main input was to standardize terms like 'delayed' vs 'pending' to avoid misinterpretation."}
{"ts": "148:03", "speaker": "I", "text": "From a design system perspective, did DS-ATLAS v2 require any updates to support those states?"}
{"ts": "148:08", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we added a 'sync-state' token set, which includes color, iconography, and motion presets. This was versioned as DS-ATLAS v2.1 and documented in Confluence page DS-ATLAS-STATE. Engineering could then consume those tokens in both iOS and Android builds without divergence."}
{"ts": "148:18", "speaker": "I", "text": "How did you validate those changes under offline conditions?"}
{"ts": "148:23", "speaker": "E", "text": "We used the MobileLab harness to simulate network loss scenarios, per test plan TP-ATL-OFF-04. QA paired with UX to run through accessibility checklists — including screen reader announcements for sync states — to ensure parity with our WCAG 2.1 AA target."}
{"ts": "148:34", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there any surprises during that testing?"}
{"ts": "148:38", "speaker": "E", "text": "One thing — on Android, certain TalkBack versions misread the 'pending' state as 'pen ding'. We logged it as BUG-ATL-563. We issued a workaround in the token's alt-text mapping, pending a platform fix."}
{"ts": "148:48", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given all these fine-grained mitigations, what’s your confidence level in scaling now?"}
{"ts": "148:52", "speaker": "E", "text": "With the staged rollout plan, enhanced telemetry, and DS-ATLAS v2.1 support, I'd say confidence is high. The main residual risk is unpredictable mobile OS updates, which we’re addressing with pre-release beta channels and monthly regression sweeps."}
{"ts": "149:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the pilot's sync model – at this stage, how are you evaluating the risk of data collisions when multiple offline sessions come online simultaneously?"}
{"ts": "149:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Right, so for that we established a conflict resolution matrix in runbook RB-ATL-07. It defines priority rules per entity type, and we test those with synthetic load in the staging environment. We also log any unresolved conflicts into a specific ticket category, ATL-SYNC, so we can do root cause reviews."}
{"ts": "149:24", "speaker": "I", "text": "And those reviews, do they involve engineering only or also UX?"}
{"ts": "149:28", "speaker": "E", "text": "We involve UX because sometimes the resolution path is not technical but communicative – for example, prompting the user with a merge UI. That was evident in ticket ATL-SYNC-114, where we realised a subtle change in copy would prevent confusion."}
{"ts": "149:39", "speaker": "I", "text": "How does that tie into the 'Safety First' principle you referenced before?"}
{"ts": "149:45", "speaker": "E", "text": "Well, 'Safety First' in our context means no silent data loss. So any auto-merge must be non-destructive. We even added a POL-QA-014 note that QA must verify the UI path for conflict handling in every regression suite."}
{"ts": "149:56", "speaker": "I", "text": "In scaling this to production, what tradeoffs did you have to consider between performance and those safety measures?"}
{"ts": "150:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "The biggest tradeoff is latency. If you insist on full conflict scans before syncing, you slow down the perceived responsiveness. We decided, per RFC-ATL-202, to batch low-risk merges client-side and run high-risk merges through a slower, verified server process."}
{"ts": "150:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did you test that batching under realistic network constraints?"}
{"ts": "150:19", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we used the mobile lab's network shaper to simulate 2G up to LTE. Under 2G, batch merge latency remains under our SLA of 5 seconds for low-risk entities. Anything higher risk still notifies the user, which aligns with our UX accessibility commitments."}
{"ts": "150:31", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of accessibility, does that notification mechanism conform to the guidelines you mentioned?"}
{"ts": "150:36", "speaker": "E", "text": "Absolutely. All merge notifications are exposed via the platform's assistive API, with role and state attributes consistent with DS-ATLAS v2 tokens. We validated with both screen readers and switch control during the last regression cycle."}
{"ts": "150:48", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there any scaling risks that emerged only after integrating those accessibility hooks?"}
{"ts": "150:53", "speaker": "E", "text": "One risk was increased memory footprint on lower-end devices because accessible state caching added overhead. We mitigated this by lazy-loading accessibility metadata, as documented in change request CR-ATL-88."}
{"ts": "151:03", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking ahead, how will you monitor these risks in production?"}
{"ts": "151:06", "speaker": "E", "text": "We'll integrate metrics into our mobile observability stack—tracking merge conflict rates, notification delivery times, and accessibility API error logs. Alerts will route via the same PagerDuty bridge used by SRE, ensuring both engineering and UX are looped in if thresholds from SLA-MOB-02 are breached."}
{"ts": "151:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the multi-tier caching in the offline sync—how did that interplay with the feature flag system during the pilot stress tests?"}
{"ts": "151:14", "speaker": "E", "text": "Right, so in the pilot we had to ensure that any feature flag change propagated in a way that didn't corrupt cached state. We used a handshake protocol defined in RFC-ATL-079 where the client checks the flag payload version before applying updates to the local Realm store."}
{"ts": "151:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "Was that layered into your design system components themselves or purely in the data layer?"}
{"ts": "151:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "A bit of both. The DS-ATLAS v2 components have hooks for state hydration. That means when a flag toggles a feature on, the UI renders in a safe default state while the sync layer verifies data integrity. We documented this in runbook RB-UX-009 for cross-team reference."}
{"ts": "151:49", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. And those hooks, do they also support accessibility states?"}
{"ts": "151:54", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, each tokenized component carries ARIA role mappings and color contrast tokens. So even if the content is loading from offline cache, assistive tech reads out the placeholder text per WCAG AA. We validated that with synthetic voiceover tests in the staging app."}
{"ts": "152:10", "speaker": "I", "text": "That ties nicely into POL-QA-014’s risk-based testing, right? How did UX feed into that?"}
{"ts": "152:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. For any UI component tied to critical flags—like identity verification—we add it to the 'High Impact' risk bucket in the QA matrix. That triggers extra regression passes, including manual exploratory runs with screen readers offline."}
{"ts": "152:31", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there any points where security pushed back on a UX flow during the pilot?"}
{"ts": "152:36", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, ticket SEC-ATL-142 flagged that our offline login screen was too verbose about error states, potentially leaking internal codes. We revised the microcopy to be more generic and added a 'retry later' path per SEC-GD-05."}
{"ts": "152:52", "speaker": "I", "text": "When you think about scaling, do you foresee that handshake protocol becoming a bottleneck?"}
{"ts": "152:57", "speaker": "E", "text": "Potentially. In lab tests with 10k concurrent users, handshake retries added up to 150ms extra latency. For production, we're considering delta-sync with pre-warmed flag states pushed via our message bus to cut that overhead in half."}
{"ts": "153:12", "speaker": "I", "text": "How will you mitigate any risks if delta-sync introduces stale flags to offline users?"}
{"ts": "153:18", "speaker": "E", "text": "We're adding a watchdog in the client: if a flag hasn't been confirmed for more than 6 hours, the component drops to a 'compatibility mode' UI. That mode is stateless and tested for full offline compliance in RUN-ATL-OFF-021."}
{"ts": "153:33", "speaker": "I", "text": "Final thought—what’s the biggest lesson here you’d tell another UX lead starting a similar pilot?"}
{"ts": "153:38", "speaker": "E", "text": "Build your accessibility and sync logic into the design tokens from day one. It’s much harder to retrofit. And align with QA and Security early—our smooth pilot owes a lot to those early triage sessions logged under PILOT-ATL-MTG-03."}
{"ts": "153:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you touched on how offline sync ties into feature flag deployments. Could you expand on how that actually works in a live pilot run?"}
{"ts": "153:11", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure, so in the pilot we have a staged rollout script—it's in runbook RB-ATL-014—that ensures when a feature flag is toggled on centrally, the offline sync queues pick up that new config during the next hydration cycle. That way users who have been offline for, say, eight hours still get the intended experience when they reconnect."}
{"ts": "153:19", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how does UX validate that the transition is smooth for those users?"}
{"ts": "153:23", "speaker": "E", "text": "We build simulation scripts into our prototyping. For example, using test personas defined in ticket QA-ATL-221, we deliberately delay sync events, then watch for any visual jank or accessibility regressions when the UI rehydrates. It's... a bit like watching a timelapse of the UI catching up."}
{"ts": "153:35", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of accessibility, how do you work with QA on that front, especially with these edge cases?"}
{"ts": "153:40", "speaker": "E", "text": "We feed our UX flows into QA's risk-based matrix per POL-QA-014, tagging any that have ARIA role changes during sync. QA then runs assistive tech tests—screen readers, high contrast—under both connected and offline-to-online transitions. We learned early that some ATs misinterpret rapid DOM updates."}
{"ts": "153:53", "speaker": "I", "text": "Was there a particular incident that drove that point home?"}
{"ts": "153:57", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in pilot week 3, a flagged navigation change caused the TalkWave reader to announce menu items twice after sync. That got logged as INC-ATL-077, and we refined our re-render strategy to use tokenized component state diffs rather than full refresh."}
{"ts": "154:09", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. And how did that influence your design system integration going forward?"}
{"ts": "154:13", "speaker": "E", "text": "We updated DS-ATLAS v2 to include a sync-aware prop in core navigation components. This prop, when true, tells the renderer to preserve focus and announcement order. It's now part of the component checklist in Confluence doc DS2-MOB-ACC."}
{"ts": "154:23", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking toward scaling, how will you adapt this offline sync model for potentially thousands more users?"}
{"ts": "154:28", "speaker": "E", "text": "We'll shard sync queues by user segment and throttle non-critical flag updates during peak reconnection windows. UX-wise, that means designing loading states that can persist gracefully for up to 90 seconds without frustrating the user."}
{"ts": "154:37", "speaker": "I", "text": "Do you foresee any risks in that approach?"}
{"ts": "154:40", "speaker": "E", "text": "One risk is that delayed non-critical updates might leave some users on slightly older UI flows, which could confuse support. Mitigation is to implement subtle in-app notices sourced from the sync status API—this is in RFC-ATL-032."}
{"ts": "154:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "And are all stakeholders aligned on that tradeoff?"}
{"ts": "154:54", "speaker": "E", "text": "Mostly, yes. We had a cross-functional review with SRE, QA, and Security. Security flagged that sync notices shouldn't leak sensitive config names, so we now use generic labels like 'UI update pending'. That keeps us in line with the 'Safety First' principle and avoids data leakage."}
{"ts": "154:26", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned that offline sync was central to how feature flags roll out. Could you expand on a case where that interplay created an unexpected UX challenge?"}
{"ts": "154:31", "speaker": "E", "text": "Absolutely. In sprint 14, we had a flag—FF-ATL-098—that enabled a new forms component. Users who were offline when the flag flipped received stale schema definitions until their next sync. That meant the new component rendered incorrectly for a subset of users for up to 48 hours. We had to add a 'schema version check' into the offline cache as a hotfix, documented in runbook RB-ATL-OFF-07."}
{"ts": "154:45", "speaker": "I", "text": "How did engineering and QA coordinate on that hotfix?"}
{"ts": "154:49", "speaker": "E", "text": "We spun up a joint incident room. QA pulled in risk-based testing guidance from POL-QA-014 to prioritise regression suites affecting offline-first flows. Engineering provided a patched build in under 6 hours, which we then validated against scenarios from Test Plan TP-OFF-03."}
{"ts": "154:59", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. Did that incident feed into any permanent design changes?"}
{"ts": "155:03", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we updated the DS-ATLAS v2 form components to include a 'version mismatch' fallback state. That way, even if there's a schema drift, the UI gracefully reverts to read-only with a clear message, rather than breaking layout."}
{"ts": "155:12", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching gears—how do you handle accessibility in those fallback states?"}
{"ts": "155:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "We follow the internal Accessibility Implementation Guide v3.2, which wraps WCAG 2.2 AA. For fallback states, we ensure ARIA live regions announce the change, and we’ve tested with NVDA and VoiceOver in both online and offline modes."}
{"ts": "155:26", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there any gaps in tooling when you tested voice feedback offline?"}
{"ts": "155:30", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, some emulators don't emulate offline accessibility well. We had to script physical device tests using Device Farm Profile DF-ATL-A11Y, which adds network toggling events to the run."}
{"ts": "155:39", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given the pilot learnings, what risks are top of mind as you scale?"}
{"ts": "155:43", "speaker": "E", "text": "The biggest is sync conflict resolution at scale. In the pilot, we had under 200 users; production will have ~20k. If two large datasets merge simultaneously, latency could breach SLA-SYNC-005, which is set at 3 seconds for conflict resolution."}
{"ts": "155:54", "speaker": "I", "text": "How are you mitigating that?"}
{"ts": "155:57", "speaker": "E", "text": "We’re introducing a delta-sync algorithm and preemptive conflict detection, per RFC-ATL-DS-12. UX-wise, we designed a non-blocking conflict banner so users can continue working while conflicts resolve in the background."}
{"ts": "156:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "That seems to align with the ‘Safety First’ principle."}
{"ts": "156:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. It reduces the risk of data loss without forcing immediate user decisions under pressure, which is part of our Safety First UX checklist SF-UX-04."}
{"ts": "156:02", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned that the pilot’s offline sync model is heavily intertwined with our feature flag mechanism. Could you elaborate now on how that relationship might evolve as we scale up?"}
{"ts": "156:08", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure, in the pilot we’ve been using a fairly simple sync queue that respects the active flags—basically if a feature is off for a segment, the payload omits related data entirely. In scaling, we’re moving to a more granular sync manifest that the client can parse without pulling unnecessary modules, which is critical to keep battery and data usage within our SLA-MOB-3.1 thresholds."}
{"ts": "156:18", "speaker": "I", "text": "And that SLA-MOB-3.1, that’s the one that caps background data usage at 5MB per day per user, right?"}
{"ts": "156:23", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly, plus it includes a latency clause for sync completion under 3 seconds on 4G. We’ve had to negotiate with engineering to ensure our conditional asset loading aligns with those numbers, especially for flagged beta features."}
{"ts": "156:31", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do these constraints affect accessibility testing, particularly with assistive technologies that may require extra assets?"}
{"ts": "156:37", "speaker": "E", "text": "Good question—when we run AT-Offline-Runbook v1.4, we tag accessibility-related resources as 'essential' in the manifest. That way, even if a feature is flagged off for mainstream users, it can still push alt-text databases or voice prompt packs if the device has an enabled screen reader."}
{"ts": "156:47", "speaker": "I", "text": "Was that an agreed policy or an unwritten rule?"}
{"ts": "156:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "It started as an unwritten rule from our accessibility guild, but after a ticket—INC-UX-998—where a blind tester missed out on new navigation cues, we formalized it into POL-UX-ACC-07."}
{"ts": "156:59", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. Switching gears a little, how do you see DS-ATLAS v2’s tokenized components supporting this manifest-based sync?"}
{"ts": "157:04", "speaker": "E", "text": "Tokens let us strip down to the semantic core—color, spacing, typography—so even if a layout component is deferred due to a flag, we can still render a simplified accessible fallback that matches brand and contrast requirements. It’s a bridge between design purity and pragmatic network constraints."}
{"ts": "157:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "Does that create any friction with QA or SRE when deploying?"}
{"ts": "157:17", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sometimes—QA under POL-QA-014 wants every variation tested, even deferred ones. SRE worries about manifest complexity increasing API call variance. We’ve mitigated that by adding a manifest validator script into the CI pipeline that flags anomalies before deploy, which reduced post-deploy incidents by 40% according to our last sprint metrics."}
{"ts": "157:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking back, would you say the pilot phase prepared you well for those cross-team negotiations?"}
{"ts": "157:32", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, the pilot forced us to touch all the seams between UX, backend, and infra. We learned, for example, that Security’s input on manifest signing was as crucial to UX as the visual layer—because unsigned manifests could be tampered with, leading to inconsistent or unsafe UI states."}
{"ts": "157:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "That’s a significant risk. How did you address it?"}
{"ts": "157:45", "speaker": "E", "text": "We added RSA-based signing, with the UX build process embedding a public key check before rendering. It was a tradeoff: a 150ms delay on first load, but we accepted it based on RFC-Sec-221’s requirement for integrity verification. The decision was logged in DEC-UX-SEC-15 for traceability."}
{"ts": "157:38", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the pilot's impact on your scaling strategy—could you walk me through one risk you've identified that's directly tied to the offline sync model?"}
{"ts": "157:43", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. One of the more subtle risks is version drift between device-side caches and the cloud schema. In the pilot, with only a few hundred users, we could push schema migrations on weekends and let the sync layer reconcile. At scale, per SLA-SYNC-002, that reconciliation window must be under 90 seconds, so we have to consider a rolling migration protocol."}
{"ts": "157:54", "speaker": "I", "text": "How does that rolling migration protocol actually integrate into your feature flag rollout process?"}
{"ts": "157:59", "speaker": "E", "text": "We plan to link migration readiness to flag eligibility. The sync service will emit a 'schema_ready' signal into our feature flag broker—per RFC-FF-219—so only clients with the updated schema see the new UI paths. It’s a safeguard against user-facing desync."}
{"ts": "158:10", "speaker": "I", "text": "That makes sense. Did the pilot provide any quantitative evidence that supports this approach?"}
{"ts": "158:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in ticket SYNC-451 we tracked five instances where users toggled a feature flag mid-sync, leading to partial data renders. Post-mortem analysis showed they were on pre-migration schemas. That’s the exact scenario the new protocol aims to prevent."}
{"ts": "158:27", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching gears slightly, how are you preparing the UX deliverables for security review as you head toward production?"}
{"ts": "158:32", "speaker": "E", "text": "We’ve embedded security checkpoints into our design QA. For example, before finalising the offline login flow, we ran it past SEC-RUN-102, which outlines threat modelling for cached credentials. That involved pairing with the SRE team to simulate device compromise scenarios."}
{"ts": "158:44", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there any significant design changes as a result of those simulations?"}
{"ts": "158:48", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we added an interstitial that forces a re-auth after 12 hours of offline use, even if the sync hasn’t occurred. It’s a compromise between uninterrupted access and mitigating stale token abuse, directly aligning with the 'Safety First' principle in POL-QA-014."}
{"ts": "158:59", "speaker": "I", "text": "Going back to accessibility—how will you validate that this re-auth flow is still usable for people relying on assistive tech?"}
{"ts": "159:04", "speaker": "E", "text": "We’re adding it to our AT regression suite. In the pilot we already ran TalkBack and VoiceOver scenarios offline, but for this we’ll script a forced re-auth in the lab and measure completion times, per our ACC-TEST-09 guideline."}
{"ts": "159:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "From a scaling perspective, what’s the biggest unknown left before you can commit to production rollout?"}
{"ts": "159:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "Honestly, concurrent sync under poor network conditions. We’ve tested offline and good 4G, but the mixed cases—like partial connectivity spikes—can cause merge conflicts we haven't fully profiled. We have a run in PREPROD-ENV-3 scheduled next month to gather metrics."}
{"ts": "159:32", "speaker": "I", "text": "And if those metrics show high conflict rates?"}
{"ts": "159:36", "speaker": "E", "text": "Then we'll have to consider delaying certain feature flags tied to complex data models until we can implement a more deterministic conflict resolution algorithm. It would be a tough call, but the pilot has shown us that early restraint can save a lot of downstream churn."}
{"ts": "159:38", "speaker": "I", "text": "You mentioned earlier that the pilot phase has revealed some unexpected UX constraints. Could you give a concrete example of one that directly shaped your scaling roadmap?"}
{"ts": "159:44", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. One big one was around our offline sync queue prioritisation. In the pilot, we saw that low‑bandwidth users in rural areas were experiencing delays because the sync engine didn't differentiate between critical and non‑critical payloads. That insight forced us to draft RFC‑ATL‑092, which proposes a priority channel system for scale‑up."}
{"ts": "159:57", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how did that tie back to the UX side of the house?"}
{"ts": "160:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "We had to redesign the sync status UI to surface different states — 'essential data pending', 'background sync', etc. — so users understood why certain updates appeared faster. This aligns with our POL‑UX‑008 guidelines on user feedback for asynchronous processes."}
{"ts": "160:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did that require collaboration with SRE or QA to validate under simulated load?"}
{"ts": "160:21", "speaker": "E", "text": "Absolutely. SRE ran load tests in the staging cluster using synthetic accounts flagged with the new sync priorities. QA then used Runbook QA‑RB‑042 to verify visual indicators rendered correctly under packet loss simulations. That gave us confidence to bake the change into the scale strategy."}
{"ts": "160:37", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking at accessibility, are there any new risks when scaling this prioritisation?"}
{"ts": "160:42", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, especially for screen reader users. If the state changes too frequently during sync, it can create a noisy experience. We're mitigating that by throttling ARIA live region updates — it's documented in ACC‑NOTE‑17."}
{"ts": "160:54", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. How does that interplay with the feature flag system during rollout?"}
{"ts": "161:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use a staged flag release. First, we enable the priority sync feature for internal testers and beta users, monitoring both sync metrics and accessibility logs. If no regressions per SLA‑ATL‑SYNC are detected, we expand. The flags let us roll back instantly if user feedback indicates confusion."}
{"ts": "161:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there any security reviews tied to changing sync prioritisation?"}
{"ts": "161:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, SecOps opened TCK‑SEC‑441 to ensure no sensitive payloads were deprioritised in a way that might expose stale data risks. We updated the data classification rules in the sync scheduler accordingly."}
{"ts": "161:32", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given all this, what's your biggest trade‑off decision as you move from pilot to production?"}
{"ts": "161:38", "speaker": "E", "text": "Balancing user transparency with operational complexity. Showing more sync states helps trust, but increases UI logic and potential for bugs. We've decided to maintain a minimal set of states for production, deferring granular views to an 'advanced' mode — per decision log DEC‑ATL‑117."}
{"ts": "161:52", "speaker": "I", "text": "And you're confident that aligns with your 'Safety First' principle?"}
{"ts": "161:57", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, because 'Safety First' here means ensuring critical information is accurate and timely. By prioritising essential payloads and simplifying user messaging, we're reducing the risk of misinterpretation while keeping the system maintainable."}
{"ts": "161:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you touched on how DS-ATLAS v2 supports compliance. Could you expand on any recent design review where compliance feedback significantly altered the component spec?"}
{"ts": "161:18", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, two weeks ago we had a review with our internal compliance officer under RFC-CMP-221. Initially, the tokenized date picker did not meet the minimum hit area for users with motor impairments. We altered the padding variables in the DS tokens directly, which meant engineering just re-pulled the DS-ATLAS package and redeployed without refactoring the consuming screens."}
{"ts": "161:27", "speaker": "I", "text": "That sounds efficient. How was this change communicated to QA, especially given the risk-based testing in POL-QA-014?"}
{"ts": "161:32", "speaker": "E", "text": "We leveraged the runbook RB-QA-Atlas-07. It prescribes that any DS token changes trigger a targeted regression of affected UI flows. QA got an automated Slack alert from our CI pipeline tagging the relevant Jira tickets, in this case QA-ATL-304."}
{"ts": "161:41", "speaker": "I", "text": "Moving to offline sync — have you encountered any unexpected user behavior in the pilot that led to refinement of the sync scheduler?"}
{"ts": "161:46", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, a subset of field testers in low-connectivity zones would force-close the app mid-sync. Our logs showed partial writes. We modified the scheduler to use a resumable state as per our architectural RFC-ATL-112, and added a UX affordance — a visual indicator of sync progress — so users understood to keep the app open."}
{"ts": "161:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. Did that require coordination with SRE for backend adjustments?"}
{"ts": "161:59", "speaker": "E", "text": "Absolutely. SRE updated the sync API to accept partial payloads and maintain an idempotency token. It was documented in the SRE Confluence page SRV-AtlasSync-Delta. We then adjusted our UX copy to explain retries in human-readable terms."}
{"ts": "162:07", "speaker": "I", "text": "On the scaling front, how will you adapt this resumable model for a much larger user base?"}
{"ts": "162:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "We’re planning to shard sync queues by user region to reduce contention. UX-wise, we’ll localize status messages and tie them into the feature flag system so we can A/B test different progress indicators without redeploying the core sync logic."}
{"ts": "162:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "What are the key risks you foresee during that scaling?"}
{"ts": "162:24", "speaker": "E", "text": "Two main ones: first, latency spikes under load could cause UI timers to desync from backend completion; second, increased variability in device performance might break our accessibility timing guidelines under WCAG 2.1 SC 2.2.1. We have mitigation playbooks drafted in RB-Scale-Atlas-02."}
{"ts": "162:34", "speaker": "I", "text": "Can you give an example from the pilot where UX changes directly supported the 'Safety First' principle?"}
{"ts": "162:39", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, when we introduced biometric login under feature flag FF-BIO-ATL, we added a fallback delay to prevent brute-force attempts even offline. This aligns with Safety First by ensuring that failed attempts offline still increment a local counter and lockout, synced to the server when back online."}
{"ts": "162:48", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, as you wrap up the pilot, what’s your biggest lesson learned that you’ll carry into production?"}
{"ts": "162:52", "speaker": "E", "text": "That tight integration between design tokens and our feature flag framework dramatically reduces turnaround on compliance-driven UX changes. It’s given us a template for scaling without sacrificing accessibility or performance — something we’ll bake into the production governance model."}
{"ts": "162:49", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned how the offline sync architecture ties into feature flag rollouts. Could you elaborate on a specific instance where that interplay affected a release decision?"}
{"ts": "162:54", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, sure. In sprint 14 we had a case—ticket UX-457—where we were staging a new document annotation feature. The feature flag was set to 5% rollout, but our sync engine was still using the delta-patch v1 protocol. During QA, we found that users offline for more than 48 hours would receive outdated flags upon reconnection. That meant we couldn't reliably test the feature in low-connectivity areas. We ended up holding back the flag expansion until the delta-patch v2 landed, per runbook RB-SYNC-003."}
{"ts": "163:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "So that directly delayed the rollout schedule?"}
{"ts": "163:18", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly, and it was a joint call with SRE to avoid violating the pilot SLA of 98% feature uptime for active testers. The irony was, the actual code was ready, but the infrastructure guarantee wasn't."}
{"ts": "163:29", "speaker": "I", "text": "How did you communicate that to stakeholders who might not be technical?"}
{"ts": "163:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "We prepared a short impact brief using the POL-QA-014 format, mapping the risk from technical terms into user experience impact: 'Potential loss of new feature access post-offline period.' That way, product and marketing could align messaging and avoid promising availability we couldn't ensure."}
{"ts": "163:48", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching gears, in terms of accessibility, have you had to make any late-stage tradeoffs during the pilot?"}
{"ts": "163:52", "speaker": "E", "text": "One clear instance was the voice command integration. Our DS-ATLAS v2 tokens supported semantic labels, but the command parser in the mobile shell wasn't fully compliant with the updated WCAG 2.2 timing rules. We opted to disable the voice shortcut in the finance module for the pilot to avoid non-compliance, documenting it in RFC-ACC-017."}
{"ts": "164:10", "speaker": "I", "text": "Was that a difficult decision to make?"}
{"ts": "164:13", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, because it impacted inclusivity for low-mobility users. Our mitigation was to prioritise an adaptive button layout for the same tasks, which passed accessibility audits in both iOS and Android builds."}
{"ts": "164:25", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking ahead to scaling, what risks are top of mind based on these pilot lessons?"}
{"ts": "164:30", "speaker": "E", "text": "The biggest is sync consistency across a larger, geographically distributed user base. The pilot's 30 testers were all within Europe. Global rollout introduces latency variables that could resurface the flag staleness issue. We're drafting a pre-scale checklist in RB-SCALE-002 to enforce minimum sync heartbeat intervals."}
{"ts": "164:46", "speaker": "I", "text": "And in terms of UX, how do you plan to adapt for that?"}
{"ts": "164:49", "speaker": "E", "text": "We're designing subtle in-app indicators that show sync freshness, so users understand if they're seeing the latest data. It's a balance: too prominent and it creates anxiety, too hidden and it erodes trust if content changes unexpectedly."}
{"ts": "165:02", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, any unwritten rules you follow when making these tradeoffs?"}
{"ts": "165:06", "speaker": "E", "text": "One rule we keep is 'never surprise the user in critical flows.' Even if it means delaying a feature or adding a small step, predictability trumps novelty—especially in a regulated context like ours."}
{"ts": "164:29", "speaker": "I", "text": "Before we wrap, I want to drill into one of the late-stage decisions—how did you balance the trade-off between richer offline capabilities and security constraints?"}
{"ts": "164:35", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yeah, that was a key discussion in the last sprint review. We had to weigh the sync granularity against our encryption overhead. Runbook RB-SYNC-004 actually outlines a tiered caching policy, but applying it meant accepting higher latency on decrypt during first load. We opted for tier two caching for non-sensitive metadata, which satisfied SEC-CHK-71 without compromising too much on perceived speed."}
{"ts": "164:49", "speaker": "I", "text": "Was that decision influenced by any specific incidents or pilot feedback?"}
{"ts": "164:53", "speaker": "E", "text": "It was. Ticket ATL-PILOT-212 recorded multiple user reports about initial screen blanking when offline. SRE correlated that with the full decryption pass on startup. So, we used that as evidence to justify moving some non-critical assets to the tier two cache in the next build."}
{"ts": "165:04", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. Did you have to get an exemption from the 'Safety First' principle for that?"}
{"ts": "165:08", "speaker": "E", "text": "Not exactly an exemption. We went through the POL-QA-014 risk-based testing path. Security signed off after we demonstrated via test case set QA-OFF-SEC-09 that no PII was ever stored in tier two cache and that integrity checks still ran every 30 minutes."}
{"ts": "165:19", "speaker": "I", "text": "How did the design system accommodate that change? Any component updates?"}
{"ts": "165:23", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, DS-ATLAS v2’s asset loader token had to be extended. We introduced a 'cache-tier' property in the token spec, so both native and web builds could request the right asset version. That way, devs didn't hardcode any storage logic—just passed the tier in the component config."}
