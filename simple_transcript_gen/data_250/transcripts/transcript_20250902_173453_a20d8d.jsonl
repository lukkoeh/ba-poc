{"ts": "00:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "To start us off, can you outline for me the primary business problem that the Orion Edge Gateway is designed to solve within Novereon Systems?"}
{"ts": "02:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. Orion Edge Gateway is meant to unify how our external and partner-facing APIs are exposed. Right now, we have multiple legacy ingress points with inconsistent authentication flows, and that fragments the developer experience. This project consolidates them, enforces rate limiting per SLA-ORI-02, and integrates directly with the Aegis IAM so that partners only authenticate once and can access multiple services."}
{"ts": "05:10", "speaker": "I", "text": "And what would you say are the key success metrics or SLOs you're targeting?"}
{"ts": "07:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have three main ones. First, p95 latency under 250ms for authenticated requests, per SLA-ORI-02. Second, 99.95% monthly availability, matching our external partner commitments. Third, zero known vulnerabilities above CVSS 7.0 in any deployed build, which ties into our security objectives. We track these via Nimbus Observability dashboards that already have the SLO widgets configured."}
{"ts": "10:30", "speaker": "I", "text": "Could you describe the core components and their interactions within the gateway architecture?"}
{"ts": "14:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "There are four main components: the ingress controller, which handles TLS termination and initial request parsing; the policy engine, which applies rate limits and verifies auth tokens via Aegis IAM; the routing module, which forwards traffic to downstream microservices; and the observability agent, which pushes request metrics and traces to Nimbus. They communicate over gRPC internally to minimize serialization overhead."}
{"ts": "17:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "On that note, how exactly does the gateway integrate with Aegis IAM for authentication?"}
{"ts": "20:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use the Aegis token introspection endpoint over mutual TLS. The policy engine has a JIT access module that fetches scopes based on POL-SEC-001. It caches them for 60 seconds to balance performance with security. If Aegis is unreachable, we fall back to a pre-approved minimal scope set to avoid full outages."}
{"ts": "24:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of POL-SEC-001, how have you ensured compliance with its Least Privilege & Just-In-Time Access requirements?"}
{"ts": "28:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We audited all service-to-service calls to ensure they only request the specific scopes they need, and we implemented automated credential expiry after 5 minutes of inactivity. This is documented in RFC-ORI-014 and validated by our internal security team in ticket SEC-441."}
{"ts": "32:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let's talk operational readiness. What runbooks are in place for deployment and rollback?"}
{"ts": "36:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have RBK-ORI-DEP-03, which is a blue/green deployment procedure leveraging our container orchestrator. It specifies how to divert 10% of live traffic to the new version, monitor for 30 minutes, then proceed to full cutover. Rollback is a simple route switch in the ingress controller, documented in the same runbook."}
{"ts": "40:40", "speaker": "I", "text": "And before go-live, how are you validating that p95 latency SLO?"}
{"ts": "45:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We run synthetic load tests using our sim-clients with recorded partner traffic patterns. The tests run for 4 hours, and results are ingested into Nimbus for comparison against SLA-ORI-02 thresholds. We also test under degraded Aegis IAM response times to see the impact."}
{"ts": "49:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "That brings us to dependencies. How do you coordinate with Nimbus Observability for telemetry integration?"}
{"ts": "54:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a direct dependency on their Collector v5 API. We actually had to align our protobuf schema with their ingestion pipeline. Any change on their side requires us to update our observability agent, so we have a shared change calendar and bi-weekly syncs to avoid surprises."}
{"ts": "90:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the p95 latency SLA-ORI-02; now I'm curious—how are you validating that under simulated load before the first customer traffic hits production?"}
{"ts": "90:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "We run controlled benchmarks on our staging mesh using the synthetic transaction suite defined in RUNBOOK-DEP-14. That includes mixed payload sizes and auth token refresh scenarios against Aegis IAM. We also replay traces from our canary environment to ensure the load profile is realistic."}
{"ts": "90:30", "speaker": "I", "text": "And does that synthetic suite include any failure injection to measure degradation patterns?"}
{"ts": "90:41", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, per RFC-ORI-17 we apply 5% random gRPC timeout injection on the upstream service calls. It's one of the ways we verify the BLAST_RADIUS containment logic in the edge routing tier behaves as designed, routing around unhealthy shards."}
{"ts": "90:59", "speaker": "I", "text": "You mentioned earlier the dependency on Nimbus Observability. How exactly do you coordinate schema changes in telemetry with their team to avoid breakage?"}
{"ts": "91:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a shared change calendar in Confluence, but more importantly, our pipeline enforces a contract test suite from OBS-SPEC-03. Any change in our protobuf definitions for metrics must pass their validator before merge. That saved us during last month's schema update when an optional field was inadvertently made required."}
{"ts": "91:32", "speaker": "I", "text": "If Aegis IAM itself experiences degraded performance, what's the real-world impact and your contingency?"}
{"ts": "91:43", "speaker": "E", "text": "We cache signed JWTs for up to 15 minutes in our edge tier per policy override from SEC-EXC-005. That gives us a grace window to keep serving most requests during IAM slowness. The tradeoff is revocation latency, which we mitigate by pushing critical revocation events through a side channel via Kafka."}
{"ts": "92:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "That's a good segue into tradeoffs—between latency and security features, what was the hardest decision you had to make?"}
{"ts": "92:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "Honestly, the JWT cache TTL. Security reviewers wanted 5 minutes max to limit exposure, but perf tests in TICKET-ORI-245 showed a 12% latency regression with too-frequent IAM lookups. We settled at 15 minutes with event-based invalidation to balance both concerns."}
{"ts": "92:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "Post-deployment, which risks are you actively monitoring and how?"}
{"ts": "92:46", "speaker": "E", "text": "Two primary ones: elevated auth failure rates indicating IAM trouble, and per-tenant rate limiter drift. We have Prometheus alerts per ALERT-DEF-ORI-09 and a weekly review of the limiter calibration logs. Any anomalies trigger our incident runbook RUNBOOK-INC-07."}
{"ts": "93:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Do you have any manual playbooks for when automation doesn't catch an edge case?"}
{"ts": "93:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, the fallback is in RUNBOOK-MAN-02—operators can disable the adaptive routing module and pin traffic to known-good nodes while we investigate. That was last used in staging during the April chaos test."}
{"ts": "93:32", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given all that, do you feel Orion Edge Gateway is ready for its first production tenants?"}
{"ts": "93:42", "speaker": "E", "text": "With the current safeguards, tested scenarios, and the rollback path in place, yes. We have a phased rollout plan tied to SLO gates and the blast radius control features, so we can ramp confidence alongside load."}
{"ts": "98:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let's pick up where we left off—could you expand on how your runbooks incorporate partial outage scenarios for Orion Edge Gateway?"}
{"ts": "98:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. The deployment runbook ORI-RB-DEP-03 has a dedicated section on partial degradation. It instructs ops to isolate affected edge nodes using the gateway's region tag filters, then reroute traffic via unaffected zones. We also include pre-approved scripts to adjust rate limiting dynamically, to avoid overloading the healthy segments."}
{"ts": "98:38", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how is this validated before a real event?"}
{"ts": "98:44", "speaker": "E", "text": "We run quarterly chaos drills, injecting simulated latency into one edge node pool. The observability hooks from Nimbus confirm whether failover triggers are hit within the SLA-ORI-05 limit of 15 seconds."}
{"ts": "99:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of Nimbus, how closely did you have to coordinate their telemetry changes with yours?"}
{"ts": "99:14", "speaker": "E", "text": "Very closely—since Orion's metric schema had new dimensions for per-tenant rate limit breaches, we opened a change request CR-NIM-447. It ensured their ingestion pipeline could parse our enriched labels without breaking existing dashboards."}
{"ts": "99:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "What about dependencies on Aegis IAM—what's the planned response if it slows down?"}
{"ts": "99:45", "speaker": "E", "text": "Per contingency plan ORI-CON-02, if Aegis IAM latency exceeds 300ms p95 for more than 2 minutes, Orion temporarily switches to cached JWT validation for existing sessions. We track expiry with a sliding window to minimize security exposure."}
{"ts": "100:08", "speaker": "I", "text": "That brings us neatly into the latency versus security tradeoff. Could you walk me through one key decision there?"}
{"ts": "100:17", "speaker": "E", "text": "One significant choice, documented in RFC-ORI-014, was to batch certain policy lookups to Aegis during high load. It drops per-request latency by ~20ms but slightly delays revocation enforcement. We put guardrails in place via short-lived tokens, mitigating most of the risk."}
{"ts": "100:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "Was there internal pushback on that approach?"}
{"ts": "100:49", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, security review flagged it under ticket TCK-3421. We had to present simulation data showing that revocation within 30 seconds still met compliance under POL-SEC-001, given our threat model."}
{"ts": "101:08", "speaker": "I", "text": "Post-deployment, how do you monitor that this tradeoff isn't introducing unseen issues?"}
{"ts": "101:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use synthetic probes that perform forced revocation in staging and prod canaries daily, logging any token acceptance beyond the 30s window. These logs feed into an anomaly detector in Nimbus; any breach raises a P1 alert."}
{"ts": "101:39", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, are there any other risks you’re actively monitoring in the near term?"}
{"ts": "101:47", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, aside from auth latency, we watch for config drift between edge nodes. An undetected drift could bypass our rate limiting policies. We've integrated a nightly config hash diff, with automatic rollback if discrepancies exceed a 2% threshold."}
{"ts": "114:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Can we go a bit deeper into the rollback runbook you mentioned earlier? I'm curious how it handles partial deployments in the Orion Edge Gateway context."}
{"ts": "114:07", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. The rollback runbook RNBK-ORI-DEP-04 includes a staged revert process. Step one is disabling the new API routes via feature flags, step two is restoring the previous gateway container image from our artifact repo, and step three is revalidating with health checks. This ensures minimal downtime even if only a subset of nodes was updated."}
{"ts": "114:18", "speaker": "I", "text": "And does that process require coordination with Nimbus Observability for telemetry rollbacks or adjustments?"}
{"ts": "114:23", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, absolutely. When we roll back, we also revert the associated telemetry schemas. Nimbus has schema version tags; our runbook includes a call to their API to set those back to the baseline version used in the last stable release."}
{"ts": "114:34", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. How quickly can you execute that end-to-end, from decision to rollback completion?"}
{"ts": "114:39", "speaker": "E", "text": "In drills, we average about 6 minutes for the full process, with most of the time spent on verifying that Aegis IAM tokens are still valid post-revert. That check is critical because auth mismatches could block all traffic."}
{"ts": "114:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "On the subject of auth, what’s your contingency if Aegis IAM is degraded but not fully down?"}
{"ts": "114:55", "speaker": "E", "text": "We maintain a cache of short-lived JWTs generated in the last 5 minutes. If Aegis latency exceeds 2 seconds per token request, the gateway switches to cache mode for up to 15 minutes, as per SLA-ORI-SEC-07. Nimbus emits an alert when this mode is engaged."}
{"ts": "115:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned RFC-ORI-014. How did that document influence the cache duration specifically?"}
{"ts": "115:11", "speaker": "E", "text": "RFC-ORI-014 analysed the risk of stale credentials versus service availability. It concluded that 15 minutes was the optimal balance—long enough to ride out minor IAM incidents, short enough to limit exposure. Ticket TCK-3421 formalized the change in the config templates."}
{"ts": "115:22", "speaker": "I", "text": "Got it. And for monitoring after go-live, how will you distinguish between a Nimbus telemetry drop and an actual gateway performance issue?"}
{"ts": "115:27", "speaker": "E", "text": "We correlate three signals: synthetic probes hitting the gateway externally, internal p95 latency metrics from the gateway pods, and Nimbus ingestion queue depth. If probes and pods are healthy but queue depth spikes, we attribute it to Nimbus rather than the gateway."}
{"ts": "115:38", "speaker": "I", "text": "Have you tested that correlation logic in a simulated outage?"}
{"ts": "115:42", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in SIM-ORI-FAIL-02 we throttled telemetry ingestion intentionally. The alert routing correctly tagged it as an observability subsystem issue, and the on-call skipped unnecessary gateway restarts."}
{"ts": "115:53", "speaker": "I", "text": "Good to hear. Any remaining risks you're actively monitoring in the first 30 days post-deployment?"}
{"ts": "115:58", "speaker": "E", "text": "Two main ones: unpredictable latency spikes under mixed load patterns, and auth cache exhaustion if Aegis IAM has prolonged partial outages. Both are tracked with dedicated dashboards and threshold-based alerts linked to our PagerDuty rotation."}
{"ts": "116:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned how operational readiness is tied to both Nimbus Observability and Aegis IAM, could you walk me through a specific runbook step where both systems are actively involved?"}
{"ts": "116:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in the rollout runbook RUN-ORI-DEP-05, step 6.2 actually triggers a health check in Nimbus after we switch the gateway node to active mode. That health check includes a simulated login via Aegis IAM to confirm auth pathways are operational. If Nimbus reports anomalies or if Aegis returns an unexpected error code, the script auto-pauses the rollout and notifies the on-call via PagerDuty."}
{"ts": "116:45", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how long does that simulated login test usually take, in terms of impact to the deployment window?"}
{"ts": "117:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "It's about 45 seconds per node. We parallelise across clusters to keep total impact under 3 minutes. We budget that into the 30-minute rolling update slot defined in SLA-ORI-02's deployment guidelines."}
{"ts": "117:25", "speaker": "I", "text": "Got it. Let’s pivot slightly—how do you coordinate changes when Nimbus Observability itself is undergoing an upgrade?"}
{"ts": "117:40", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a dependency calendar maintained in Confluence. If Nimbus announces a maintenance window, we place a hold on any Orion Edge Gateway deployments in that timeframe. The coordination process is written in PROC-OBS-INT-03, which requires at least 48 hours notice and a dry-run of observability probes in staging."}
{"ts": "118:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "Makes sense. And in staging, do you replicate the full latency profile you expect in production?"}
{"ts": "118:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "We try to. We use traffic replay from anonymised prod captures to simulate realistic p95 and p99 latencies. That way, any integration hiccups, especially with Aegis token validation, show up before we go live."}
{"ts": "118:45", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of token validation, in RFC-ORI-014 you described a trade-off where heavy encryption added about 7ms to the auth path. How did you decide that was acceptable?"}
{"ts": "119:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We weighed it against the POL-SEC-001 directive. The 7ms overhead kept our p95 latency within SLA while hardening against token replay attacks. Ticket TCK-3421 documents the comparative benchmarks. We also kept a rollback cipher suite ready in case live metrics showed higher-than-expected impact."}
{"ts": "119:30", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did you ever have to invoke that rollback cipher suite in testing or production?"}
{"ts": "119:45", "speaker": "E", "text": "In testing, yes—during build 1.4 in staging, the new cipher clashed with an older Aegis library. We rolled back within 5 minutes following RUN-ORI-SEC-07. That incident informed our library upgrade plan for prod."}
{"ts": "120:10", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. And post-deployment, what are the top risks you’re actively monitoring now?"}
{"ts": "120:25", "speaker": "E", "text": "Three main ones: first, auth latency spikes beyond our 250ms p95 target; second, anomaly rates from synthetic probes exceeding the 0.1% threshold; and third, partial outages in upstream auth that could expand blast radius if not contained."}
{"ts": "120:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do you contain that blast radius in the auth outage scenario?"}
{"ts": "121:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We rate-limit new session initiations and allow existing sessions to persist for up to 30 minutes without re-auth. That's documented in the continuity plan CP-ORI-AUTH-02, which reduces load on Aegis while preserving service for active users."}
{"ts": "124:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the synthetic probes. Could you walk me through how those are scheduled and what kind of failure patterns they can detect?"}
{"ts": "124:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. We have them running every 30 seconds from three geographic regions. They simulate both authenticated and unauthenticated API calls, so we see latency spikes, auth timeouts, and malformed payload responses. This helps us catch subtle degradations that wouldn't trigger hard downtime alerts."}
{"ts": "124:34", "speaker": "I", "text": "And when those probes pick up an anomaly, what's the escalation path?"}
{"ts": "124:43", "speaker": "E", "text": "If the anomaly score breaches threshold 0.75 for more than two minutes, it opens an OpsGenie incident tied to the ORI-Runbook-05. First responder checks Nimbus dashboards, then runs 'check-edge-auth' script to isolate whether Aegis IAM is the root cause."}
{"ts": "125:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "Does ORI-Runbook-05 also include rollback procedures or is that separate?"}
{"ts": "125:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "It's linked. Step 7 outlines partial rollback for just the rate limiting module—this was added after a regression in build 1.4.2 documented in TCK-3559, where the limiter throttled all traffic indiscriminately."}
{"ts": "125:38", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of rate limiting, have you had to adjust the thresholds based on early load tests?"}
{"ts": "125:47", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we started at 500 req/s per client, but during pre-prod tests we saw Aegis token refresh bursts hitting 700 req/s. We coordinated with the Aegis team to mark token refresh endpoints as exempt from standard limits, per RFC-ORI-019."}
{"ts": "126:09", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. How does that exemption impact the latency budget for other endpoints?"}
{"ts": "126:17", "speaker": "E", "text": "We had to reallocate some CPU quotas in the ingress cluster. The observability metrics from Nimbus showed a 3% latency increase on analytics endpoints, but still within SLA-ORI-02's p95 of 180ms."}
{"ts": "126:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "And in terms of blast radius control, are you using namespace isolation or some other technique?"}
{"ts": "126:45", "speaker": "E", "text": "Namespace isolation plus traffic shadowing. If one tenant namespace misbehaves, we can throttle or sandbox it without touching others. This follows the mitigation pattern in POL-OPS-007 for multi-tenant environments."}
{"ts": "127:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Have these patterns been dry-run tested under incident simulations?"}
{"ts": "127:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, twice last quarter. We simulated Aegis IAM latency and a faulty analytics transformation. Both times we contained the issue within one namespace and saw zero spillover in the Nimbus traces."}
{"ts": "127:33", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking forward, what post-deployment risks are you prioritizing monitoring for?"}
{"ts": "127:42", "speaker": "E", "text": "Top three: unexpected auth schema changes from Aegis, traffic spikes from partner integrations, and config drift in rate limiting rules. For each, we have detection hooks in place and linked tickets for playbook updates—TCK-3602 for the schema changes, for example."}
{"ts": "132:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned synthetic probes—can you walk me through how those are configured specifically for the Orion Edge Gateway endpoints?"}
{"ts": "132:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. We have a runbook RBK-ORI-DEP-07 that outlines the probe configurations. Each probe simulates both authenticated and unauthenticated requests through the API gateway, hitting our staging replicas first. They measure p50, p95, and error rate, and feed directly into Nimbus Observability dashboards."}
{"ts": "132:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "And are those probes using the same auth tokens issued by Aegis IAM as production traffic?"}
{"ts": "133:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, for the authenticated paths, we integrate with the Aegis IAM sandbox environment. Tokens are short-lived—per POL-SEC-001—and we rotate them every 15 minutes in the probe agents to mimic real-world patterns."}
{"ts": "133:30", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given that, how do you handle situations where Nimbus telemetry might lag behind actual gateway performance?"}
{"ts": "133:48", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a two-tier alerting system. First-tier is in-probe thresholding—if p95 exceeds SLA-ORI-02 for more than 3 minutes, the probe itself sends a webhook to our incident channel. Second-tier is Nimbus anomaly detection, which can lag by up to 45 seconds but adds context from other services."}
{"ts": "134:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "So the in-probe alert acts as a fast-path detection, correct?"}
{"ts": "134:24", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. That was actually suggested in RFC-ORI-016 after a simulated outage test showed Nimbus alone wasn't fast enough to meet our MTTR target of 10 minutes."}
{"ts": "134:46", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching gears—can you detail a scenario where a dependency on Aegis IAM could impact partial outage handling in Orion Edge Gateway?"}
{"ts": "135:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "Absolutely. If Aegis IAM's token issuance API slows down, our auth middleware queues requests. The BLAST_RADIUS containment plan in RBK-ORI-FAIL-03 dictates that for a subset of public APIs, we bypass strict re-auth for already validated sessions, reducing user impact while still meeting security posture."}
{"ts": "135:32", "speaker": "I", "text": "That seems like a careful tradeoff—what was the decision-making process there?"}
{"ts": "135:45", "speaker": "E", "text": "We debated in the architecture review documented in TCK-3499. The tradeoff was between strict session re-validation on every request—which increases load and latency during IAM slowness—and a grace period model. We chose grace periods of 5 minutes, backed by signed session hashes, to balance availability and security."}
{"ts": "136:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Was there any pushback from security on that grace period?"}
{"ts": "136:27", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, the security guild wanted it capped at 2 minutes. We provided simulation data from STG-ORI-LOAD-11 showing negligible risk increase between 2 and 5 minutes, and significant latency improvement, which persuaded them."}
{"ts": "136:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, post-deployment, what are the top two risks you're actively monitoring?"}
{"ts": "137:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "First, regression in p95 latency when new auth providers are integrated—tracked in our watchlist ORI-RSK-05. Second, misconfigurations in rate limiting rules after hotfixes, which could either throttle legitimate traffic or let spikes through. We use config diff alerts to catch that quickly."}
{"ts": "140:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "You mentioned earlier the synthetic probes; could you clarify how they're configured to simulate both high and low load scenarios for Orion Edge Gateway?"}
{"ts": "140:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. We have two profiles in our runbook ORI-RBK-DEP-05. One simulates burst traffic up to the configured rate limit thresholds—about 2,500 requests/sec—while another mimics steady-state low throughput. Both use randomized payloads to avoid cache hits, which is critical for testing the p95 latency SLA-ORI-02 in realistic conditions."}
{"ts": "140:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "Understood. And how do these probe results feed into your deployment decisions?"}
{"ts": "141:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "After each canary deploy, we collect probe metrics via Nimbus Observability in under five minutes. If p95 exceeds 180ms for more than three consecutive probe intervals, the rollback procedure kicks in automatically, as specified in ORI-RBK-DEP-07."}
{"ts": "141:45", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of rollback, what specific steps are taken to maintain auth integrity with Aegis IAM during that process?"}
{"ts": "142:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "We maintain a shadow session store synchronized with Aegis via secure gRPC channels. On rollback, the gateway rebinds to the last known stable IAM endpoints, avoiding token replay risks. That's in compliance with POL-SEC-001 and documented in change ticket TCK-3498."}
{"ts": "142:40", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. Now, since Aegis IAM has its own maintenance windows, how does Orion Edge Gateway adapt without dropping client requests?"}
{"ts": "143:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use a local JWT validation cache with a 15-minute TTL. During Aegis downtime, as long as tokens are within TTL, we approve them; new auth requests are queued with a capped retry. This was a tradeoff agreed in RFC-ORI-016 to balance availability and security."}
{"ts": "143:35", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did that RFC also address the impact on rate limiting when operating in cache-only mode?"}
{"ts": "143:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we had to decouple rate limit counters from central IAM checks in that mode. We switch to a local counter shard to prevent abuse while Aegis is offline, but the thresholds are 10% tighter to mitigate risk."}
{"ts": "144:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "Have you stress-tested that fallback mode under synthetic attack conditions?"}
{"ts": "144:35", "speaker": "E", "text": "We did. Using our chaos testing harness, we simulated 5x normal traffic with Aegis IAM unavailable. The gateway sustained the load without breach of BLAST_RADIUS constraints, and Nimbus flagged only expected anomaly thresholds."}
{"ts": "145:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "Good. On the operational side, who signs off on proceeding from canary to full rollout?"}
{"ts": "145:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "That's a joint decision by the release manager and the SRE on duty, based on runbook criteria in ORI-RBK-DEP-09. Both sign within the deployment portal, which logs to audit trail ATR-ORI-202."}
{"ts": "145:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "Lastly, post-deployment, what are the top risks you're monitoring in the first 24 hours?"}
{"ts": "146:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "Primary ones are latency regressions beyond SLA-ORI-02, auth anomalies from Aegis IAM integration, and unexpected rate-limit triggers. We have alerts in Nimbus with synthetic IDs SYN-ORI-401, -402, and -403, each tied to an escalation runbook."}
{"ts": "148:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned RFC-ORI-014 shaping some of the gateway's security posture. Could you walk me through how those recommendations were reconciled with the p95 latency requirements from SLA-ORI-02?"}
{"ts": "148:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, so RFC-ORI-014 essentially recommended a multi-factor token verification step on every API call. That added ~12ms on average. We profiled it under load using the pre-prod cluster and saw that with adaptive caching—per TCK-3421—we could cut that to ~4ms, keeping the p95 under 110ms as mandated by SLA-ORI-02."}
{"ts": "148:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "And did you have to adjust any integration points with Nimbus Observability to measure that accurately?"}
{"ts": "148:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "We did. Nimbus originally sampled at 1:100 for latency traces. For the test period, we dropped it to 1:10 and temporarily stored the additional data in a separate shard per RUN-OBS-019. That allowed us to correlate specific auth paths from Aegis IAM with observed latency spikes."}
{"ts": "148:32", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. And did that correlation yield any surprises?"}
{"ts": "148:36", "speaker": "E", "text": "One, actually. We saw that when Aegis IAM was in degraded mode—simulated via their DRILL-AG-07—the fallback JWT validator in Orion Edge Gateway was misconfigured to refresh keys too aggressively. That caused momentary latency jumps."}
{"ts": "148:46", "speaker": "I", "text": "How did you address that before go-live?"}
{"ts": "148:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "We updated the fallback validator configuration as per FIX-ORI-287, setting a minimum refresh interval of 10 minutes. Then we re-ran the degraded-mode simulation to verify p95 stayed within threshold."}
{"ts": "149:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking at the broader risk landscape, which of these issues are you going to actively monitor post-deployment?"}
{"ts": "149:04", "speaker": "E", "text": "Two main ones: auth path latency exceeding 120ms, and error rates above 0.5% during Aegis IAM failovers. We've configured Nimbus synthetic probes to trigger TKT-ALRT-ORI-55 if either threshold is breached."}
{"ts": "149:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "Do your runbooks cover those alert responses?"}
{"ts": "149:18", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, RUN-ORI-DEP-05 has a section on 'Auth Latency Incident'. It lays out steps to first check Nimbus dashboards, then toggle the adaptive cache parameters, and escalate to the Aegis IAM on-call if no improvement within 5 minutes."}
{"ts": "149:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "And what about rollback? Is that automated or manual in this context?"}
{"ts": "149:32", "speaker": "E", "text": "For auth-layer regressions, rollback is semi-automated. The deployment pipeline has a 'RevertAuthModule' job defined in REL-PIPE-ORI-09. Triggering it restores the previous container image and config snapshot in under 3 minutes."}
{"ts": "149:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "Final question—do you foresee any tradeoffs here that might need revisiting in the first month post-launch?"}
{"ts": "149:46", "speaker": "E", "text": "Potentially the balance between cache aggressiveness and token revocation speed. If we see security events where revoked tokens remain valid longer than acceptable, per SEC-POL-017, we may need to tighten the cache at the expense of a few milliseconds latency. That'll be a live decision based on week-one data."}
{"ts": "150:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the p95 latency SLA-ORI-02; can you walk me through how you validated it under load before the final build freeze?"}
{"ts": "150:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we used a staged load profile—starting at 50% of expected peak and ramping to 120%. We ran these profiles in the pre-prod cluster, with synthetic payloads matching the most common API patterns; we monitored with Nimbus Observability's percentile dashboards to ensure p95 stayed below 180ms."}
{"ts": "150:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "And did you incorporate any failure scenarios into those tests?"}
{"ts": "151:05", "speaker": "E", "text": "We did. We simulated degraded responses from Aegis IAM by introducing 300ms artificial latency on token introspection calls. That allowed us to verify the gateway's circuit breaker logic and see how the fallback cache reduced the impact on overall p95."}
{"ts": "151:35", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting—so that ties into the blast radius limitation you outlined in the runbook RBK-ORI-DEP-03."}
{"ts": "151:50", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. That runbook specifies isolating auth failures to affected tenants by adjusting the routing table dynamically, which is triggered by the anomaly thresholds we configured in Nimbus."}
{"ts": "152:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there any surprises during these resilience tests?"}
{"ts": "152:30", "speaker": "E", "text": "One minor issue—during a partial outage simulation, the retry storm on downstream services exceeded our rate limiter ceiling. We updated the limiter config, per TCK-3567, to include exponential backoff for retries."}
{"ts": "152:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "How did you coordinate that limiter change across teams?"}
{"ts": "153:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "We raised an internal RFC, RFC-ORI-022, and had joint review with the Core API team. Since the rate limiter module is shared, we aligned the config schema and rolled it out via the shared Helm chart, using feature flags to toggle per environment."}
{"ts": "153:40", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were those feature flags part of your compliance strategy for POL-SEC-001?"}
{"ts": "153:55", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes—they let us enforce least privilege at the config level. Only the SRE lead can toggle the flags in production, and access is granted just-in-time via our privileged access workflow."}
{"ts": "154:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given the adjustments, do you foresee any impact on meeting the go-live date?"}
{"ts": "154:35", "speaker": "E", "text": "No, the changes were applied in parallel to other readiness tasks. We completed regression testing last Friday and updated the deployment checklist to reflect the new limiter behavior."}
{"ts": "154:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "Great, and are there any open risks you’re still monitoring in the post-deployment phase?"}
{"ts": "155:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "We’re keeping an eye on token cache staleness under burst load. It’s logged under RSK-ORI-007, with mitigation steps in RBK-ORI-OPS-02. If cache staleness exceeds 60 seconds, we trigger a controlled cache flush and alert the on-call engineer."}
{"ts": "152:00", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned synthetic probes in passing – could you walk me through how those are configured specifically for Orion Edge Gateway under SLA-ORI-02?"}
{"ts": "152:06", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. Each probe instance runs from three geo-distributed PoPs, hitting our public API endpoints through the same ingress path as real traffic. The config comes from runbook RB-ORI-DEP-05, and includes p95 latency alerts at 180ms. The probes simulate both authenticated and unauthenticated calls to test Aegis IAM integration too."}
{"ts": "152:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "And in terms of authentication, how are you verifying that failures in Aegis IAM don’t skew those latency metrics?"}
{"ts": "152:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "We tag probe results with an auth_status field. If Aegis IAM is degraded, the Nimbus Observability pipeline can filter those out when calculating SLA compliance. This came from an incident in P-ORI test phase where false positives triggered an escalation."}
{"ts": "152:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "That filtering logic—was it documented anywhere formal?"}
{"ts": "152:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, it's in TCK-3504, which amended RB-OBS-03 for cross-system metric hygiene. The change also referenced SEC-POL-002, to ensure no sensitive fields are logged in those tags."}
{"ts": "152:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "Now, about deployment: when you roll out a new build, how do you limit the blast radius if a defect slips through?"}
{"ts": "152:48", "speaker": "E", "text": "We use canary deployments to 5% of the gateway fleet, with regional isolation. This is orchestrated via our internal tool Beltane, per RB-ORI-DEP-02. If anomalies cross threshold ANOM-ORI-07, automatic rollback is triggered for that region only."}
{"ts": "152:57", "speaker": "I", "text": "Is there a dependency on Nimbus Observability for that rollback trigger?"}
{"ts": "153:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, it relies on Nimbus’s real-time anomaly detection stream. We had to coordinate with their team under portfolio sync meeting M-PORT-11 to ensure sub-5s latency in event delivery, otherwise rollback might lag."}
{"ts": "153:11", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of coordination, what happens if Nimbus is down during a deployment?"}
{"ts": "153:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a contingency: local node-level anomaly checks using a lightweight ruleset derived from RFC-OBS-019. It covers core KPIs like error_rate and p95 latency, with thresholds slightly tighter than SLA to err on the side of safety."}
{"ts": "153:25", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let’s touch on risk. Which risk are you most actively monitoring post-deploy now?"}
{"ts": "153:30", "speaker": "E", "text": "The biggest is auth latency spike during peak load. As per RFC-ORI-014, we accepted a minor increase in handshake time for enhanced token validation. TCK-3421 tracks the mitigation plan: caching certain non-sensitive claims to shave 20ms off without violating POL-SEC-001."}
{"ts": "153:39", "speaker": "I", "text": "So that’s a tradeoff firmly rooted in security posture, but with operational guardrails?"}
{"ts": "153:44", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. We weighed the risk of potential token misuse against the cost of a few ms latency. The guardrails—synthetic probes, anomaly thresholds, canary rollouts—ensure we can detect and react before it impacts customers materially."}
{"ts": "153:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you referenced our synthetic probe setup—can you walk me through how that ties into the rollback runbook?"}
{"ts": "153:41", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. In the rollback runbook RBK-ORI-07, step three explicitly checks the probe dashboard in Nimbus Observability. If p95 latency or error rates exceed the SLA-ORI-02 thresholds for more than 90 seconds post-deploy, we trigger the automated rollback pipeline."}
{"ts": "153:49", "speaker": "I", "text": "And that automation—is it fully hands-off or does it require a human approval?"}
{"ts": "153:54", "speaker": "E", "text": "It’s semi-automatic. The pipeline will prep the rollback artifacts and push a Slack alert to the on-call channel. Per POL-OPS-004, an SRE must confirm within five minutes to execute."}
{"ts": "154:01", "speaker": "I", "text": "Got it. How does this intersect with the JIT access provisioning under POL-SEC-001?"}
{"ts": "154:06", "speaker": "E", "text": "We embedded a hook in the rollback job to request a JIT role from Aegis IAM. That way, only the on-call SRE with the temporary credential can approve and run systems changes—ensuring we stay least-privileged even under pressure."}
{"ts": "154:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "In the context of dependencies—have you tested this when Aegis IAM itself is degraded?"}
{"ts": "154:19", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we simulated a 50% auth latency increase via the staging IAM emulator. The rollback script can fall back to a pre-approved emergency token stored in HashVault, valid for 15 minutes."}
{"ts": "154:26", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. Was that fallback path documented somewhere accessible?"}
{"ts": "154:30", "speaker": "E", "text": "It’s in runbook appendix C, and cross-referenced in incident template TMP-INC-ORI-03 so responders know where to find it mid-incident."}
{"ts": "154:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking back, any tradeoff you’d reconsider now that you’ve run these drills?"}
{"ts": "154:41", "speaker": "E", "text": "Possibly the decision per RFC-ORI-018 to prioritise encryption handshake freshness over a small latency budget. In practice, the additional 12ms TLS renegotiation cost sometimes tips us over the p95 target during high load."}
{"ts": "154:50", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given that, have you proposed any mitigation?"}
{"ts": "154:54", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, TCK-3510 is open to evaluate TLS session resumption with strict lifetime bounds. That could shave ~8ms off without weakening security, based on lab benchmarks."}
{"ts": "155:01", "speaker": "I", "text": "What risks would you keep monitoring post-deployment in this scenario?"}
{"ts": "155:06", "speaker": "E", "text": "Two main ones: session cache poisoning attempts, which Nimbus can flag via anomaly detection signatures, and IAM outage overlap, which we mitigate through the emergency token drill we discussed."}
{"ts": "155:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Before we wrap, I'd like to go deeper into the rollback procedures you mentioned earlier. Could you walk me through the exact steps from the runbook RBK-ORI-DEP-07?"}
{"ts": "155:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. RBK-ORI-DEP-07 specifies a staged rollback: first, we disable new ingress routes through the API gateway routing config, then drain existing connections. Once p95 latency drops below the safe threshold, we redeploy the last known good container image, tagged 'stable-ORI', and re-enable routes. The whole process is orchestrated via our Jenkins pipeline with manual approval gates."}
{"ts": "155:25", "speaker": "I", "text": "And in the context of monitoring, how do you validate that the rollback actually resolved the incident?"}
{"ts": "155:32", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a post-rollback validation script, VAL-ORI-03, that triggers synthetic probes hitting the top five critical API endpoints. It checks for both response codes and latency against SLA-ORI-02. Only if all pass for a 10-minute window do we mark the incident as resolved in the incident tracker."}
{"ts": "155:46", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of the tracker, which ticketing workflow do you follow for such rollbacks?"}
{"ts": "155:52", "speaker": "E", "text": "We follow the OPS-INC-Workflow v4.2. Any rollback triggers a P1 incident ticket in JIRA-SIM, gets linked to the deployment change record, and requires a post-mortem doc within 48 hours. That doc also references any relevant RFCs, like RFC-ORI-014 if latency/security was implicated."}
{"ts": "156:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned coordination with Nimbus Observability. How does that tie into the rollback loop?"}
{"ts": "156:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Nimbus pushes real-time metrics into our Grafana dashboards, but during rollback, we enable a special 'rollback mode' dashboard profile. It focuses on error rate, CPU load, and external dependency health from Aegis IAM. That way, we can see if the symptoms subside as we roll back."}
{"ts": "156:27", "speaker": "I", "text": "Have you ever encountered a case where rollback didn't fix the symptom?"}
{"ts": "156:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, once. It turned out the root cause was in the upstream rate-limiter service shared with another project. Rollback of our gateway didn't help because the bottleneck was external. In TCK-3554 we documented that and adjusted our blast radius plan to include cross-team escalation."}
{"ts": "156:48", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. So that ties into the blast radius limiting strategy—could you elaborate on the changes you made after TCK-3554?"}
{"ts": "156:55", "speaker": "E", "text": "We added conditional routing rules that detect upstream degradation and automatically shed non-critical traffic classes. This is codified in POL-HA-017 and implemented via Envoy filters. It prevents a full outage when an external dependency fails."}
{"ts": "157:09", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking ahead, are there any particular risks you're monitoring closely post-deployment?"}
{"ts": "157:15", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes. The main ones are JWT validation latency from Aegis IAM and memory leaks in the rate-limiter module. For the first, we set anomaly thresholds in Nimbus to alert if validation takes more than 50ms for 5 minutes. For the second, we run a nightly soak test."}
{"ts": "157:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given the trade-off between tight security and low latency from RFC-ORI-014, have you considered revisiting that decision?"}
{"ts": "157:35", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a review scheduled in Q4. The idea is to re-benchmark with the latest Aegis IAM release, which claims faster token introspection. If we can shave off 10–15ms without weakening the signature checks, we'd update the gateway policy. That would address some of the concerns documented in TCK-3421."}
{"ts": "156:42", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the synthetic probes; can you walk me through how those results were benchmarked against SLA-ORI-02 before go-live?"}
{"ts": "156:48", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, so in staging we ran continuous probes from three geo-regions, each simulating realistic API calls through the Orion Edge Gateway. We compared the collected p95 latency to the SLA threshold of 220ms defined in SLA-ORI-02. Any deviation above 200ms triggered a pre-prod alert in line with our Runbook RB-ORI-DEP-05."}
{"ts": "156:59", "speaker": "I", "text": "And were there any false positives during that stage?"}
{"ts": "157:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "A few, mainly because the Nimbus Observability test nodes in APAC had intermittent ISP routing issues. We documented those in QA note QAN-ORI-17 and adjusted the anomaly detection threshold from 1.8x baseline to 2.2x to avoid noise."}
{"ts": "157:12", "speaker": "I", "text": "Understood. How have you planned the rollback in case after deployment the auth integration with Aegis IAM fails under load?"}
{"ts": "157:18", "speaker": "E", "text": "The rollback is defined in RB-ORI-DEP-05 section 4. It uses our blue/green deployment pattern. If the new green stack fails the Aegis handshake at more than 5% of auth requests in a five‑minute window, traffic is switched back to the blue environment. All relevant session tokens are revalidated using Aegis’ bulk validation API."}
{"ts": "157:32", "speaker": "I", "text": "That links nicely to cross-project dependencies. If Aegis IAM is degraded, do you have a contingency to keep some functionality up?"}
{"ts": "157:37", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, per Contingency Plan CP-ORI-03, Orion can operate in a limited anonymous mode for five minutes, caching auth responses locally. Nimbus’s telemetry is used to monitor this mode and enforce a BLAST_RADIUS limit by only allowing GET requests to public APIs."}
{"ts": "157:48", "speaker": "I", "text": "Moving toward risks: what’s a key trade-off you made between latency and security here?"}
{"ts": "157:52", "speaker": "E", "text": "In RFC-ORI-014 we decided to enable HMAC verification on all inter-service calls, which adds ~12ms overhead. We accepted that to reduce risk of request tampering, informed by incident INC-SEC-22 last quarter. Ticket TCK-3421 captured the decision matrix comparing HMAC vs. mutual TLS."}
{"ts": "158:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "And are you actively monitoring any residual risks post-deployment?"}
{"ts": "158:09", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, two main ones: CPU saturation during burst traffic, and Aegis IAM latency spikes. For the first, we have Nimbus alerts bound to 70% CPU over 3 minutes. For the second, synthetic login probes every 30s will trigger a warning if p95 exceeds 300ms."}
{"ts": "158:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given these controls, what’s your confidence level in meeting the SLOs?"}
{"ts": "158:23", "speaker": "E", "text": "High, assuming upstream dependencies remain within their own SLAs. The layered monitoring, rollback, and contingency modes mean we can detect and respond within our 10‑minute MTTR target from SLA-ORI-02."}
{"ts": "158:32", "speaker": "I", "text": "Finally, any undocumented heuristics your team uses in these Gateway projects?"}
{"ts": "158:36", "speaker": "E", "text": "One is to always warm up caches with the top 100 API calls post-deploy, even though it’s not in a runbook. We’ve found that removes 60% of initial latency spikes and prevents Nimbus from logging transient anomalies that would otherwise page the on-call."}
{"ts": "158:18", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned those synthetic probes we run before go‑live. Could you walk me through how you validate SLA‑ORI‑02 on p95 latency with them, step by step?"}
{"ts": "158:23", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. We have a runbook, RB‑ORI‑DEP‑05, that describes spinning up a controlled load in our staging mirror. The probes send authenticated and unauthenticated requests through Orion Edge Gateway, with rate limiting toggled on and off, and we measure response times over a 15‑minute steady‑state window. If the p95 exceeds 180ms in two consecutive runs, we halt the release pipeline automatically."}
{"ts": "158:37", "speaker": "I", "text": "And that halt—does it integrate with your CI/CD tooling or is it manual intervention?"}
{"ts": "158:41", "speaker": "E", "text": "It’s fully integrated. The halt is triggered via a webhook into our CI orchestrator. There's a manual override step, but per OPS‑POL‑07, overrides need SRE lead approval logged against the build ID."}
{"ts": "158:53", "speaker": "I", "text": "Got it. On the blast radius topic—if a partial outage hits a specific auth provider, how do you scope the impact?"}
{"ts": "158:59", "speaker": "E", "text": "We segment by tenant and provider mapping. The gateway has feature flags, documented in CFG‑ORI‑AUTH‑MAP, that allow us to route affected tenants to a degraded‑capability path with cached tokens while unaffected tenants use normal flow. That way, only 10–15% of traffic is impacted in worst case."}
{"ts": "159:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "That degraded‑capability path—does it comply with POL‑SEC‑001?"}
{"ts": "159:18", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we limit cache TTL to three minutes and scope the cached token to minimal privileges. The runbook RB‑ORI‑AUTH‑FAILBACK details the TTL enforcement and logging requirements to stay within least privilege and JIT access policies."}
{"ts": "159:32", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking beyond Aegis IAM, what other systems feed into Orion Edge Gateway that could become single points of failure?"}
{"ts": "159:38", "speaker": "E", "text": "Nimbus Observability, definitely, as we rely on it for adaptive throttling data; also the Atlas Config Service, which pushes routing rules. If Atlas lags, we fall back to last‑known‑good configs stored locally."}
{"ts": "159:51", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do you coordinate changes with Nimbus?"}
{"ts": "159:55", "speaker": "E", "text": "Weekly syncs with their team, plus we have a change calendar in CAL‑PORTFOLIO where both projects log high‑impact updates. Before each Orion release, we freeze telemetry schema changes for 48 hours to avoid misaligned metrics ingestion."}
{"ts": "160:08", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given RFC‑ORI‑014's conclusions on latency vs. security, have you seen any real incidents where that trade‑off came into play?"}
{"ts": "160:13", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, during load test LT‑ORI‑Q3 we hit 210ms p95 when deep packet inspection was enabled for all routes. Following TCK‑3421, we reduced inspection scope to high‑risk endpoints only, bringing p95 back to 170ms. The security team accepted the narrower scope with compensating controls."}
{"ts": "160:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "What’s your plan for monitoring that post‑deployment?"}
{"ts": "160:32", "speaker": "E", "text": "We’ve set anomaly thresholds in Nimbus for both latency and inspection coverage metrics. Synthetic probes generate weekly compliance reports; if inspection coverage drops below 92% on high‑risk endpoints, an alert is sent to both SRE and SecOps for review within 4 hours."}
{"ts": "159:54", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned that the runbooks for Orion Edge Gateway are fairly complete. Could you walk me through the rollback sequence briefly?"}
{"ts": "160:00", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. The rollback sequence is defined in RBK-ORI-03. It starts with disabling new ingress routes via the gateway control plane, then draining active connections for roughly 90 seconds. After that, we redeploy the previous stable container image from our artifact registry and reattach to the upstream service mesh."}
{"ts": "160:13", "speaker": "I", "text": "And do you validate the rollback before fully resuming traffic?"}
{"ts": "160:17", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, we do a smoke test using our pre-configured synthetic probes—it's part of step 8 in RBK-ORI-03. Only if all p95 latency checks pass within SLA-ORI-02 limits do we re-enable the routes."}
{"ts": "160:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "Got it. Now, since Aegis IAM is a dependency, what’s your procedure if their token validation latency spikes?"}
{"ts": "160:34", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a fallback mode described in FBP-ORI-01. If token validation exceeds 400ms for more than 2 minutes, we switch to cached token claims for up to five minutes while raising an alert to the on-call. This keeps most traffic flowing without breaching POL-SEC-001."}
{"ts": "160:49", "speaker": "I", "text": "That ties into limiting the blast radius, right?"}
{"ts": "160:53", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. By localising the issue to only auth-heavy endpoints, we avoid full gateway degradation. We also coordinate with Nimbus Observability to tag all incidents involving fallback so post-mortems can correlate across projects."}
{"ts": "161:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of Nimbus, how are you using their telemetry during build phase to preempt issues?"}
{"ts": "161:11", "speaker": "E", "text": "We've integrated their early-stage tracing hooks into our staging environment. That lets us see cross-service call chains before we even hit production, which caught an N+1 request pattern in our quota enforcement module—fixed under ticket TCK-3552."}
{"ts": "161:26", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. And from a risk perspective, how did that finding influence your design choices?"}
{"ts": "161:31", "speaker": "E", "text": "Well, it reinforced a decision we'd made in RFC-ORI-018 to batch quota checks asynchronously when possible. That was a tradeoff: slightly more complex code paths, but significantly lower latency under load."}
{"ts": "161:44", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there dissenting views on that approach?"}
{"ts": "161:48", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, some argued for synchronous checks for simplicity and immediate feedback. But our simulations, documented in SIM-ORI-07, showed we’d blow past the 200ms target on peak days if we didn’t decouple those calls."}
{"ts": "162:02", "speaker": "I", "text": "So to close the loop, post-deployment you’ll be monitoring both latency and security compliance on those async paths?"}
{"ts": "162:07", "speaker": "E", "text": "Absolutely. We have dual alerts: one from Nimbus for latency anomalies, and one custom validator that samples async processed requests to ensure they still meet the auth requirement per POL-SEC-001. That's our balance of performance and security in practice."}
{"ts": "161:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned SLA-ORI-02 for p95 latency. Could you walk me through specifically how you're validating that before we even think about go-live?"}
{"ts": "161:34", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. We've set up pre-prod environments that mirror production topology, including the same ingress controllers and API gateway instances. For each build, our CI/CD pipeline triggers a load-test job using the 'lt-orion' profile, which simulates realistic traffic patterns. The job's results are compared against the SLA threshold of 180ms p95 latency, and any breach fails the pipeline."}
{"ts": "161:48", "speaker": "I", "text": "And is that tied into Nimbus Observability yet, or are you running those metrics in isolation?"}
{"ts": "161:53", "speaker": "E", "text": "We do both. In fact, Nimbus has a synthetic probe configuration we call 'SYN-ORI-BUILD', which sends scripted API calls during build validation. That data is ingested into our Grafana dashboards, so we can compare CI/CD results with continuous baseline measurements."}
{"ts": "162:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Okay. You also mentioned earlier POL-SEC-001 compliance. How did you ensure least privilege in the API gateway’s integration with Aegis IAM?"}
{"ts": "162:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Right, so access tokens issued by Aegis IAM are scoped to the minimal set of claims needed per route. We've enforced that through route-level policy files; and we automated token TTL enforcement via a sidecar that revokes unused tokens after 5 minutes. That was audited under SEC-AUD-ORI-07 last month."}
{"ts": "162:26", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let's switch gears: runbooks. What’s your rollback procedure if a deployment goes sideways?"}
{"ts": "162:31", "speaker": "E", "text": "Our runbook RUN-ORI-DEP-004 defines a blue/green switchback. We deploy new gateway instances in a green pool, shift 10% of traffic using the load balancer. If error rate climbs above 2% for more than 90 seconds, we trigger an automated DNS shift back to the blue pool. That rollback completes in under 3 minutes."}
{"ts": "162:47", "speaker": "I", "text": "And in terms of blast radius, what’s the containment plan during partial outages?"}
{"ts": "162:52", "speaker": "E", "text": "We partition tenants across separate gateway clusters. If a cluster fails health checks—Nimbus detects via heartbeat endpoints—the routing layer isolates it, preventing cross-tenant impact. That design was validated in DR-TEST-ORI-09."}
{"ts": "163:05", "speaker": "I", "text": "Dependencies: what’s the current contingency if Aegis IAM experiences degraded performance?"}
{"ts": "163:10", "speaker": "E", "text": "We cache token introspection results for up to 60 seconds in the gateway's secure store. If IAM latency spikes, gateways continue serving cached authorizations. We monitor IAM's /health endpoint and have a failover path to a secondary IAM cluster in another region."}
{"ts": "163:24", "speaker": "I", "text": "Let’s revisit the latency-security trade-off you noted in RFC-ORI-014 and ticket TCK-3421. Could you summarise the decision and its rationale?"}
{"ts": "163:30", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes. Initially, we planned full payload encryption between microservices, but test runs showed a 40ms overhead per hop. RFC-ORI-014 proposed switching to header-level encryption for non-sensitive payloads, cutting latency to within SLA-ORI-02 bounds. TCK-3421 tracked the implementation and required explicit sign-off from Security and Performance leads."}
{"ts": "163:46", "speaker": "I", "text": "And post-deployment, which risks from that decision are you monitoring?"}
{"ts": "163:51", "speaker": "E", "text": "We’re watching for any anomalous patterns in partially encrypted traffic using Nimbus's anomaly thresholds. If suspicious activity is detected, the runbook RUN-ORI-SEC-002 guides us to temporarily re-enable full encryption for affected routes while investigating."}
{"ts": "162:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned RFC-ORI-014 — could you now walk me through how that document actually influenced the final architecture choices for Orion Edge Gateway?"}
{"ts": "162:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, so RFC-ORI-014 basically codified the acceptable p95 latency ceiling at 180 ms while mandating token introspection for every request. That meant we had to rework the API routing layer to cache specific claims without breaching POL-SEC-001. The architecture diagram in Appendix B of the RFC was actually the one we implemented."}
{"ts": "162:47", "speaker": "I", "text": "And in terms of integration, how did those constraints play out when connecting to the Aegis IAM service?"}
{"ts": "162:52", "speaker": "E", "text": "We set up a dual-path auth check. Primary flow hits Aegis via a gRPC channel with mTLS, and a fallback uses the local JWT verifier seeded from Aegis' JWK endpoint every 90 seconds. That was a direct mitigation from TCK-3421 where we saw spikes during IAM maintenance windows."}
{"ts": "163:04", "speaker": "I", "text": "Did you have to adjust any of the rate limiting modules to accommodate that fallback?"}
{"ts": "163:09", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly, we moved the rate limiter to operate post-auth in fallback mode, otherwise we'd unnecessarily throttle benign traffic. This change was captured in ChangeSet CS-ORI-87 and updated in the deployment runbook v3.2."}
{"ts": "163:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "On the subject of runbooks, what steps are in place for a rollback if, say, the cache desyncs with Aegis?"}
{"ts": "163:26", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a three-step rollback: first, disable the local verifier via feature flag FF-ORI-LOCALAUTH; second, flush the API gateway's auth cache; third, redeploy the last known good container image from registry tag `orion-edge:stable`. This sequence is in Runbook ORI-RB-05."}
{"ts": "163:40", "speaker": "I", "text": "Good. How are you validating the p95 latency of 180 ms before going live?"}
{"ts": "163:45", "speaker": "E", "text": "We run synthetic load tests from three regions, each with 10k requests/minute, and feed that into Nimbus Observability. The pre-prod dashboard has a latency budget widget that turns red if any region exceeds 170 ms, giving us a buffer before breaching SLA-ORI-02."}
{"ts": "163:59", "speaker": "I", "text": "And if one region does breach in testing, what’s the blast radius plan?"}
{"ts": "164:04", "speaker": "E", "text": "We can route 40% of that region's traffic to the nearest healthy PoP and 60% to a cloud burst-capable pool. Service mesh rules for that are defined in PolicyMesh-ORI.yaml, so ops can enact it within two minutes."}
{"ts": "164:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there any tradeoffs in implementing that reroute mechanism?"}
{"ts": "164:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, rerouting increases average latency by ~35 ms due to extra hops, which we deemed acceptable versus full outage. This decision was signed off in CAB meeting minutes CAB-2024-05-14, citing risk analysis RSK-ORI-22."}
{"ts": "164:33", "speaker": "I", "text": "Which risks are you monitoring most closely after deployment?"}
{"ts": "164:38", "speaker": "E", "text": "Top three are: IAM token validation delays, rate limiter misconfigurations under burst loads, and observability blind spots if Nimbus agents fail. We’ve set anomaly thresholds at 3σ for latency and 5% error rate, with PagerDuty hooks for the on-call team."}
{"ts": "164:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the deployment runbooks, but could you walk me through the rollback steps specifically for Orion Edge Gateway?"}
{"ts": "164:44", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. The rollback procedure is codified in RUN-ORI-DEP-07. It uses our GitOps pipeline to redeploy the last green build from the artifact store, then drains traffic from the faulty pods via weighted routing in the service mesh. We also trigger a config snapshot restore for the Envoy layer to match that build."}
{"ts": "164:59", "speaker": "I", "text": "And is there an automated verification step after rollback to ensure stability?"}
{"ts": "165:06", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, the pipeline runs a battery of smoke tests against key endpoints, checks p95 latency under synthetic load, and verifies auth flows with Aegis IAM in staging mode. Only after these pass do we re-enable 100% production traffic."}
{"ts": "165:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "Speaking of latency, the SLA-ORI-02 target is quite strict. How do you test that before go-live?"}
{"ts": "165:28", "speaker": "E", "text": "We spin up a replica of the production topology in our perf cluster, use JMeter scripts seeded from real traffic patterns, and run for 6 hours. Results are ingested by Nimbus Observability dashboards, and we set alert thresholds at 80% of SLA to give us a buffer."}
{"ts": "165:44", "speaker": "I", "text": "If Aegis IAM suffers degraded performance during that test, what’s your contingency?"}
{"ts": "165:51", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a mock token issuer that can be toggled via feature flag in the gateway. In perf tests, we can simulate IAM slowness and validate our timeout and retry logic. In production, if IAM is degraded, the gateway can fall back to cached JWT validation for a limited time as per RFC-ORI-021."}
{"ts": "166:09", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. Now on blast radius during partial outages — how is that limited?"}
{"ts": "166:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "We segment tenants into isolated routing pools. If one pool misbehaves, the circuit breakers trip only for that pool. This is enforced through Envoy cluster configs and validated by chaos experiments documented in TCK-3578."}
{"ts": "166:30", "speaker": "I", "text": "Were there tradeoffs between implementing that segmentation and latency?"}
{"ts": "166:36", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, segmentation adds extra lookups in the routing table, introducing ~2ms overhead. In RFC-ORI-019, we weighed that against the risk of cross-tenant impact. Given customer SLAs tolerate up to +5ms variance, we accepted the cost for the isolation benefit."}
{"ts": "166:51", "speaker": "I", "text": "Post-deployment, which risks will you be monitoring most closely?"}
{"ts": "166:57", "speaker": "E", "text": "Primarily auth latency spikes when Aegis IAM rotates keys, memory pressure in the rate limiting service under burst load, and drift in Envoy config versions across clusters. These are tracked in our risk register RSK-ORI-Q1-24 with remediation playbooks attached."}
{"ts": "167:11", "speaker": "I", "text": "And those playbooks, are they cross-referenced in the runbooks we discussed earlier?"}
{"ts": "167:17", "speaker": "E", "text": "They are. RUN-ORI-DEP-07 links to PBK-ORI-AL-03 for auth issues, PBK-ORI-MEM-05 for rate limiting memory leaks, and PBK-ORI-CFG-02 for config drift. This ensures the on-call can pivot quickly from detection to mitigation."}
{"ts": "172:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned the synthetic probes—can you elaborate on how they are tuned to catch anomalies without triggering false positives during peak loads?"}
{"ts": "172:44", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. We use a baseline window of the last 14 days to train our anomaly detection thresholds, and then apply a ±15% envelope to account for expected diurnal peaks. The runbook RNBK-ORI-DEP-07 has a step to temporarily widen thresholds during known marketing campaigns to avoid alert fatigue."}
{"ts": "172:59", "speaker": "I", "text": "And is that envelope applied uniformly across all endpoints exposed via Orion Edge Gateway?"}
{"ts": "173:04", "speaker": "E", "text": "No, it's per endpoint group. API clusters with higher volatility, like /pricing or /recommendations, have a 20% envelope, while stable clusters like /auth stay at 10%. This links directly to our SLA-ORI-02 testing strategy."}
{"ts": "173:18", "speaker": "I", "text": "How do you ensure that the SLA testing doesn't interfere with production traffic, especially as we approach go-live?"}
{"ts": "173:25", "speaker": "E", "text": "We tag SLA probes with a special header X-ORI-Test and route them through a shadow traffic path defined in the gateway's config. This was added after ticket TCK-3498 uncovered that earlier test runs were skewing p95 latency measurements."}
{"ts": "173:41", "speaker": "I", "text": "Interesting. Shifting to integration—what’s your fallback if Nimbus Observability fails to ingest logs from Orion Edge Gateway?"}
{"ts": "173:48", "speaker": "E", "text": "We have a dual-path. The primary path streams via gRPC to Nimbus, but we also write JSONL logs to a local buffer disk. If ingestion fails for more than 3 minutes, a cron triggers LOG-BCK-02, compresses the backlog, and pushes it via SFTP to our internal archive. This ensures audit compliance with POL-SEC-002."}
{"ts": "174:07", "speaker": "I", "text": "Does that local buffer introduce any security concerns, given it contains potentially sensitive metadata?"}
{"ts": "174:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, and that's why we encrypt at rest using AES-256 with keys rotated daily by Aegis IAM's key management module. Access is governed by POL-SEC-001 Least Privilege, so only on-call SREs with JIT approval can mount the buffer."}
{"ts": "174:27", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given the AES-256 encryption, did you observe any measurable impact on write latency to that buffer?"}
{"ts": "174:33", "speaker": "E", "text": "We did a benchmark under TST-ORI-ENCRYPT-05. The overhead was about 2.1 ms per write, which is acceptable since the buffer is a fallback path. We documented this tradeoff in RFC-ORI-017, weighing minimal latency impact against significant security gain."}
{"ts": "174:49", "speaker": "I", "text": "And RFC-ORI-017—was that reviewed by both the security and performance teams?"}
{"ts": "174:54", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, it went through dual sign-off. Security confirmed compliance with internal cryptography standards, while Performance validated that the additional latency wouldn't push us over the SLA thresholds, even in burst scenarios."}
{"ts": "175:06", "speaker": "I", "text": "Looking ahead, what’s one operational risk you’ll be monitoring most closely in the first 48 hours after go-live?"}
{"ts": "175:12", "speaker": "E", "text": "The main one is cascading auth failures if Aegis IAM's token refresh endpoint slows down. We have a feature flag to extend token TTLs from 15 to 45 minutes temporarily, as per contingency plan CNT-ORI-AUTH-01, to reduce load and buy time for remediation."}
{"ts": "180:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "Earlier you mentioned RFC-ORI-014—can you walk me through how that specifically altered your rate limiting algorithm in the Orion Edge Gateway?"}
{"ts": "180:44", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. Initially, we had a fixed token bucket configuration, but RFC-ORI-014 required dynamic adjustment based on p95 latency feedback from Nimbus Observability. So the algorithm now ingests those metrics via an internal gRPC stream, and scales the refill rate to avoid breaching SLA-ORI-02 under load."}
{"ts": "180:58", "speaker": "I", "text": "And that means the gateway is making real-time decisions on throughput to stay within latency targets?"}
{"ts": "181:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "Exactly. It's a feedback loop—our synthetic probes hit the public API every 15 seconds, Nimbus forwards anomalies, and the gateway's control plane adjusts rate limits within 50ms of detection."}
{"ts": "181:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "What about authentication—did those changes affect the integration with Aegis IAM?"}
{"ts": "181:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "Indirectly, yes. We had to ensure token validation calls to Aegis IAM were batched when possible. RFC-ORI-014 noted that security should not be compromised, so we preserved full JWT signature verification per request, but we optimised network calls with a short-lived local cache per gateway node."}
{"ts": "181:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "So you balanced the latency impact with the security requirement—how was that decision documented?"}
{"ts": "181:41", "speaker": "E", "text": "That was in TCK-3421, which contains the performance test results comparing cached vs non-cached validation. It also logs the exceptions for which cache bypasses are enforced, like on JIT role elevation per POL-SEC-001."}
{"ts": "181:55", "speaker": "I", "text": "For operational readiness, have you updated the rollback runbook to reflect these dynamic behaviours?"}
{"ts": "182:01", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, RUN-ORI-DEP-07 now includes a section on disabling adaptive rate limiting via a feature flag in Consul, if anomalies are suspected to be due to the algorithm rather than upstream systems."}
{"ts": "182:14", "speaker": "I", "text": "And what's the contingency if Aegis IAM is degraded? We touched on it briefly earlier."}
{"ts": "182:19", "speaker": "E", "text": "In that case, RUN-ORI-AEG-02 prescribes a fallback to a read-only auth token cache for up to 5 minutes, while alerting on-call via PagerDuty. This limits the BLAST_RADIUS to non-mutating endpoints until IAM recovers."}
{"ts": "182:34", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given all that, what risks are you tracking post-deployment?"}
{"ts": "182:39", "speaker": "E", "text": "We’re monitoring for feedback oscillations in the adaptive rate limiter—if Nimbus metrics lag, we could over-throttle. We also have a watch on token cache staleness if Aegis IAM has partial outages."}
{"ts": "182:51", "speaker": "I", "text": "How are those risks surfaced to the team?"}
{"ts": "182:55", "speaker": "E", "text": "Through our Ops dashboard—Nimbus sends alerts tagged with RSK-ORI-ADAPT or RSK-ORI-CACHE, and the runbooks are linked directly in the alert payload so engineers can act without hunting for docs."}
{"ts": "186:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "At this point I’d like to revisit the operational runbook sequence you mentioned earlier; can you walk me through the rollback section in detail?"}
{"ts": "186:44", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. The rollback procedure in RBK-ORI-05 is structured in three stages: immediate halt of new ingress traffic via the ingress controller, configuration rollback using the last known good manifest from our GitOps repo, and a validation cycle through staging endpoints. Each stage has a timed checkpoint—if validation fails twice, we escalate to the incident bridge per INC-ORI-221."}
{"ts": "186:58", "speaker": "I", "text": "And that manifest—how is it versioned to ensure we don’t accidentally deploy a partially tested build?"}
{"ts": "187:06", "speaker": "E", "text": "We tag them with a composite key: build ID from CI plus the SHA of the integration tests suite commit. This way, if the integration tests were updated after the build, that manifest is invalidated. Our deployment controller checks this key against the test registry before allowing rollout."}
{"ts": "187:20", "speaker": "I", "text": "You mentioned earlier synthetic probes for SLA-ORI-02. How exactly are those configured to catch p95 latency breaches pre-go-live?"}
{"ts": "187:29", "speaker": "E", "text": "They run in a simulated production namespace, sending a mix of auth-heavy and lightweight API calls every 500ms. The probes log latency histograms to Nimbus Observability, and we have an alert threshold at 280ms for p95 to give us headroom before the 300ms SLA breach. Failures trigger TST-ENV-77 review tickets."}
{"ts": "187:44", "speaker": "I", "text": "Given that Aegis IAM is in the auth-heavy path, what’s the contingency if its performance degrades mid-test?"}
{"ts": "187:53", "speaker": "E", "text": "We inject a mock token service that mimics Aegis IAM JWTs but without outbound network calls. That lets us isolate whether latency is upstream in IAM or inside Orion Edge. If IAM is the bottleneck, our runbook ORI-FALLBACK-02 switches selected routes to a cached claims verifier for up to 15 minutes."}
{"ts": "188:08", "speaker": "I", "text": "Does that fallback comply with POL-SEC-001 regarding least privilege and just-in-time access?"}
{"ts": "188:16", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, because the cache is populated only by active sessions verified within the last five minutes, and access is scoped to the original permissions. We got security sign-off in SEC-REV-ORI-19 before including it."}
{"ts": "188:28", "speaker": "I", "text": "Switching gears—any dependencies on other portfolio projects besides Nimbus and Aegis that could delay go-live?"}
{"ts": "188:36", "speaker": "E", "text": "We depend on Helios Config Service for dynamic rate-limit policies. If Helios is unavailable, Orion Edge defaults to static limits baked into the config, which could impact burst handling. We’ve documented this in DEP-MAP-ORI-v3."}
{"ts": "188:48", "speaker": "I", "text": "When you made the latency vs security tradeoff we discussed with RFC-ORI-014, what concrete evidence pushed you toward the current balance?"}
{"ts": "188:57", "speaker": "E", "text": "It was the combination of load test results from TCK-3421 showing a 40ms drop when we switched to elliptic curve keys, and the security team’s analysis in SEC-ASSMNT-44 confirming that the shorter key length still met compliance. Balancing those inputs gave us acceptable latency without downgrading security."}
{"ts": "189:12", "speaker": "I", "text": "Post-deployment, which risks will you monitor most closely?"}
{"ts": "189:20", "speaker": "E", "text": "Two main ones: auth token replay attempts, which we’ll watch via anomaly scores in Nimbus, and sudden spikes in rate-limit breaches that could indicate abuse or config drift in Helios. Both have dedicated dashboards and on-call runbooks to respond within 10 minutes."}
{"ts": "194:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "Before we wrap, I'd like to revisit how the runbooks handle simultaneous degradations in both the API gateway and the Aegis IAM service."}
{"ts": "194:44", "speaker": "E", "text": "Sure. The deployment runbook RBK-ORI-DEP-07 has a section on dual-service impact. Step 4.3 specifies invoking the fallback auth token cache if Aegis IAM latency breaches 800ms for more than three consecutive probes."}
{"ts": "194:56", "speaker": "I", "text": "And how does that integrate with the partial outage containment plan you mentioned earlier?"}
{"ts": "195:02", "speaker": "E", "text": "We link it directly. The BLAST_RADIUS_LIMITER script, defined in RBK-ORI-OPS-02, will automatically segment traffic by tenant group. That means even if auth tokens are stale, only a subset of tenants are impacted until Aegis recovers."}
{"ts": "195:15", "speaker": "I", "text": "Was this tested under the p95 latency SLA-ORI-02 conditions?"}
{"ts": "195:21", "speaker": "E", "text": "Yes, in the last synthetic load test cycle, we injected 300ms added latency to the auth path while maintaining 2x normal request volume. The limiter reduced affected tenant responses under the 950ms p95 threshold."}
{"ts": "195:36", "speaker": "I", "text": "I see. Shifting gears—how are you coordinating with Nimbus Observability for early warning signals?"}
{"ts": "195:43", "speaker": "E", "text": "Nimbus has an RFC, OBS-RFC-019, that defines cross-service anomaly correlation. We've subscribed Orion Edge Gateway to the same Kafka topic that carries Aegis IAM health metrics, so our alert engine can pre-emptively trigger the limiter."}
